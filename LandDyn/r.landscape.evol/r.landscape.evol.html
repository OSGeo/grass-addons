<h2>NAME</h2>
<em><b>r.landscape.evol</b></em>  - Create raster maps of net erosion/depostion, the modified terrain surface (DEM) after net erosion/deposition using the USPED equation, bedrock elevations after soil production, and soil depth maps. This module uses appropriate flow on different landforms by default; however, singular flow regimes can be chosen instead. THIS SCRIPT WILL PRODUCE MANY TEMPORARY MAPS AND REQUIRES A LOT OF FREE FILE SPACE!

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p><em>r.landscape.evol</em> takes as input a raster digital elevation
model (DEM) of surface topography and an input raster DEM of bedrock elevations,
 as well as several environmental variables, and computes  the net change in elevation due to erosion and deposition using the USPED equation. The module has the ability to run recursively, looping over several iterations. The time interval represneted by each iteration is determined by the scale of the input environmental variables. The script creates a new map where each raster
cell carries a numerical value, which represents the simulated meters
of erosion or deposition (ED) estimated for that cell, under the
specified conditions of rainfall intensity, soil erodability, water
flow, and vegetation cover. This map of net ED is then added to (for
deposition) or subtracted from (for erosion) the topography map of
the previous time step, to create a new topography map (i.e., as a
DEM) after a cycle of landuse and landscape change.</P>
<p>
<p> <b>R</b>, <b>K</b>, and <b>C</b> are environmental factors relating to the intensity of yearly rainfall, the erodability of soil, and the degree to which vegetation cover prevents erosion (See below for a detailed description of these factors). <b>cutoff1</b>, and <b>cutoff2</b> are values of flow accumulation (number of upslope contributing cells) that determine where surface processes change from soil-creep to overland (laminar) flow and from overland flow to channelized (turbulent) flow respectively. <b>kappa</b> is the rate of diffusion for soil-creep in meters per 1000 years. <b>sdensity</b> is the density of the soil in grams per cubic centimeters. These measures are all determined empirically for a given landscape under a given climatic condition. 
<p>
<p>By default, <em>r.watershed</em> is used to calculate flow accumulation modeling (currently only using SFD alglrithm). In GRASS 6.4 and higher, this will result in drastically faster run times, but in GRASS 6.3 and lower, this will result in drastically slower run times. Therefore, users of GRASS 6.3 and lower are encouraged to use flag <b>-f</b> whcih will use <em>r.terraflow</em> for flow accuulation modeling instead.
<p>If the output of an initial run shows artifacts, the user may opt to smooth the DEM at each time step. The user may also opt to also create maps of various statistical measures from the output of all iterations, and the <b>statsout</b> option defines the name of the file that contains the
statistics of erosion, deposition, and soil depths over all iterations. The default name is <tt>"mapset"_"prefix"_lsevol_stats.txt</tt>
(in the users home directory).

<h2>CALCULATING SURFACE EROSION AND DEPOSITION</h2></P>
<P>Because physical
laws that govern the flow of water across landscapes and its ability
to erode, entrain, transport, and deposit sediments can be expressed
in mathematical form, they can be translated into a scripting
algorithm that modifies raster landscapes (i.e., in the GIS) in ways
analogous to the ways in which real-world landscapes change. There
are various mathematical expressions of the relevant surface
processes in the geomorphological literature—depending for example
on the processes selected to be represented, the simplicity of
representation desired, and the degree of resolution desired (Clevis,
et al. 2006; Degani, et al. 1979; Mitas and Mitasova 1998; Mitasova,
Hofierka, et al. 1996; Mitasova and Mitas 2001a, b; Peeters, et al.
2006; Singh and Phadke 2006; Warren, et al. 2005; Wischmeier, et al.
1971; Wischmeier and Smith 1978). We use the Unit Stream Power
Erosion-Deposition (USPED) equation, derived in part from the
widely-used Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) (American
Society of Agricultural Engineers 2003; Degani, et al. 1979;
Mitasova, et al. 2001; Mitasova, Mitas, et al. 1996; Mitasova, et al.
2004; Singh and Phadke 2006; Warren, et al. 2005; Wischmeier 1976;
Wischmeier, et al. 1971; Wischmeier and Smith 1978), to calculate net
erosion and deposiiton across each landscape cell. USPED was
developed for hillslopes, small watersheds, and small channels (i.e.,
rills and gullies) (Warren, et al. 2005); it is less applicable to
larger streams and rivers. This makes it useful for many
archaeological settings including arid, semi-arid, and xeric regions
like those that surround much of the Mediterranean basin. 
</P>
<P>Net erosion and deposition rates are
computed from the change in sediment flow across cells of a DEM. We
approximate sediment flow rate from sediment transport capacity,
assuming that water flowing over landscapes normally carries sediment
at capacity. Transport capacity is calculated by combining a rainfall
coefficient (R, MJ mm/ha h yr), soil erodability coefficient (K, Mg
ha h/ha MJ mm), and coefficient for the ability of vegetation to
prevent erosion (C, unitless) from RUSLE with with an estimate of
topographically driven stream power as shown in equation (1)</P>
<P><I>T = R K C A</I><SUP><I>m</I></SUP><I>
(sin </I><I>B</I></FONT><I>)</I><SUP><I>n</I></SUP></P>
<P>where A is the upslope contributing
area (a measure of water flowing through a cell) and <em>B</em>
</I> is the slope of the cell. The exponents <em>m</em> and <em>n</em> are
empirically derived and vary for water flowing over nearly level
ground, on hillslopes, in water catchments at the heads of gullies,
or in small channels. The sediment flow rate is largely determined by
the amount of water flowing (contributing area), its velocity (a
function of slope), the erodability of the substrate (K factor), and
the ability of the vegetation cover to prevent erosion (C factor).
</P>
<P>Net erosion and
deposition rates are then computed as change in sediment flow in the
x and y directions across a cell, as shown in equation (2)</P>
<P><IMG SRC="r.landscape.evol_html_de331ef.gif" NAME="Object2" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE WIDTH=223 HEIGHT=40>
<P>where ED is net erosion or deposition
rate for sediment and <em>alpha</em> is the
topographic aspect (i.e., direction of slope) for a cell. Whether
flowing water will erode or deposit sediment in a particular cell is
determined by the <em>change</em> in sediment flow (transport capacity)
from one cell to the next. If the transport capacity increases (for
example, due to an increase in the steepness of the slope or amount
of flowing water), more sediment will be entrained and erosion will
occur; if the transport capacity decreases (for example, due to a
decrease in slope or water flow) sediment will be deposited.</P>
<P>
<P>Implementing the
USPED algorithm in a GRASS script combines GIS modules for
calculating slope, aspect, and flow accumulation (the amount of water
that flows across each cell) using map algebra. Data used by the
script includes a map of initial surface topography (a raster DEM),
soil erodability (a constant for uniform soil or a raster map for
variable soil), vegetation cover (a constant or raster map), and
rainfall intensity (a constant only). We also create an underlying
bedrock topography map (a raster DEM) to limit the total depth of
unconsolidated sediment that can be eroded. Soil erodability,
vegetation cover, and rainfall are expressed as the K-factor,
C-factor, and R-factor components of the RUSLE and have been
calculated empirically for a variety of setting
(Boellstorff and Benito 2005 Martínez-Casasnovas, 2000 #4092; Essa
2004; Hammad, et al. 2004; Renard, et al. 1997; Renard and Freimund
1994). 

<p>The output of this GRASS implementation of USPED must be modified in several ways in order to make it appropriate for landscape evolution simulation. First, because of the way slope is calculated in <em>r.slope.aspect</em>, the flux "T" is actually calculeted one cell downslope from where is really occurs. This causes problems when USPED is iterated over many cycles, and creates oscillating "spikes" in positive and negative flux values resulting in the calculation of alternating deep pits and high mounds at sensitive areas on the landscape. To overcome this, <em>r.landscape.evol</em> uses a nieghborhood algorithm in <em>r.mapcalc</em> to put the calcualted value of "T" back into the cell that is most uplsope from where it is originally calculated.
<p>
<p>Additionally, control must be kept for the amount of erodable sediment available to moved. <em>r.landscape.evol</em> explicitly tracks this by taking the difference between the input bedrcok elevation DEM, and the current surface topography DEM, and creating a map of "soil" depth. This map tracks the amount of material assumed to be available for entrainment and transport by surface processes. A simple logical algorithm is used to prevent unduly large amounts of erosion from being calculated in areas devoid of erodable materials (ie. at bedrock outcrops). Where this condition occurs, K is made to be very small, resulting in only extremely small amounts of erosion.
<p>
<p> Another major issue is that the total flux "T" is in units of Mg/Ha, which means it must be converted in order to calculate the change in elevation at each cell. This is done via a simple algorithm that uses the density of the soil and the cell resolution. First, "T" is multiplied by 100, to convert the flux rate to grams/square meter. This new rate is multiplied by the resolution to calculate grams flux per cell width. This is then divided by soil density to calculate cubic centimeters per cell width, which is in turn divided by the area of the cell in centimeters (resolution squared x 100 squared) to get vertical change per cell width in centimeters. Finally, this measure is divided by 100, which converts it into  meters. Several of these factors cancel out to make a final equation of "T/(10,000*soildensity*resolution)". This equation changes the orignal T from Mg/Ha to vertical change in meters over the length of one cell's width.  In order to convert the output back to Mg/Ha (standard rate for USPED/RUSLE equations), you can multiply the netchange output map by "(10000 x resolution x soil density)" to create a map of soil erosion/deposition rates across the landscape.
