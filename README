Code Compilation
################

The easiest way to compile modules against your GRASS code is
by setting MODULE_TOPDIR on the fly to tell 'make' where to
find the GRASS source code:

  make MODULE_TOPDIR=$HOME/grass63/

(adapt to your /path/to/grass6/)

# (unsure how to exclude PDF from the 'diff' email)

svn propset svn:mime-type application/x-pdf *.pdf
svn commit *.pdf
