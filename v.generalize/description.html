<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<EM>v.generalize</EM> 
is module for simplification and smoothing of GRASS vector maps. This module
comprises a bunch of algortihms for both simplification and smoothing.

<H2>NOTES</H2>
(Line) generalization is a process of reducing the compexity of vector features.
It transforms a line into another line which consists of fewer vertices but
still approximates the original line. In most of the algorithms below, this
process consists of picking subset of points of the original line.

<P>
On the other hand, (line) smoothing is a "reverse" process which takes as an
input a line and produces smoother line which approximates the original line.
In some cases, this is achieved by inserting new vertices into the line. 
Sometimes, the increase of the number of vertices is dramatical (4000%).
When this situation occurs, it is always a good idea to simplify the line after
smoothing.
</P>
<P>
All the algorithms implemented in this module work line by line. i.e simplification/smoothing
of one line does not affect the other lines. The first and the last point of
each line is never translated and/or deleted. 
</P>
<P>
If the category ranges are provided, this module affects only the lines with (at least) one of the category numbers in (at least) one category range.
</P>
<H2>SIMPLIFICATION</H2>
<P>
<EM>v.generalize</EM> contains following line simplification algorithms
<UL>
<LI>Douglas-Peucker Algorithm</LI>
<LI>Lang Algorithm</LI>
<LI>Vertex Reduction</LI>
<LI>Reumann-Witkam Algorithm</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Reuman-Witkam is the only algorithm which works only with 2D maps and does not
support 3D maps. All other algorithms (including smoothing) work with 3D maps.
</P>

Different algortihms requires different parameters, but all the algorithms have
one parameter in common. It is <B>threshold</B> parameter. In general, the degree
of simplification increases with the increasing value of <B>threshold</B>.

<H2>DETAIL DESCRIPTION</H2>
<UL>
<LI> <I>Douglas-Peucker</I> - "Quicksort" of line simplification, the most widely used
     algorithm. Input parameters: <B>input</B>, <B>threshold</B>. For more
     information, please check: <A href="http://geometryalgorithms.com/Archive/algorithm_0205/algorithm_0205.htm">http://geometryalgorithms.com/Archive/algorithm_0205/algorithm_0205.htm</A>.</LI>
<LI> <I>Lang</I> - Another standard algorithm. Input parameters: <B>input</B>, <B>threshold</B>, <B>look_ahead</B>. 
     For an excellent description, check: <A href="http://www.sli.unimelb.edu.au/gisweb/LGmodule/LGLangVisualisation.htm">http://www.sli.unimelb.edu.au/gisweb/LGmodule/LGLangVisualisation.htm</A>.</LI>
<LI> <I>Vertex Reduction</I> - Simplest among the algorithms. Input parameters: <B>input</B>, <B>threshold</B>.
     Given line, this algorithm removes the points of this line which are closer to each other than <B>threshold</B>.
     Precisely, if p1 and p2 are two consecutive points and distance between p2 and p1 is less
     than <B>threshold</B>, it removes p2 and repeats the same
     process on the remaining points.</LI>
<LI> <I>Reuman-Witkam</I> - Input parameters: <B>input</B>, <B>threshold</B>. This algorithm quite
     reasonably preserves the global characteristics of the lines. For more information

<H2>SMOOTHING</H2>
<P>
The following smoothing algorithms are implemented in <EM>v.generalize</EM>
<UL>
<LI><I>Boyle's Forward-Looking Algorithm</I> - Works by taking the average of 
    <B>look_ahead</B> consecutive points</LI>. Input parameters: <B>input</B>, <B>look_ahead</B>.
<LI><I>McMaster's Distance-Weighting Algorithm</I> - Works by taking the weighted average of <B>look_ahead</B> consecutive points
    where the weight is the distance from the point to the currently smoothed point. And parameter <B>threshold</B> is used
    for linear interpolation between the original position of the point and newly computed position where value 0 means the original position.
    Input parameters: <B>input</B>, <B>threshold</B>, <b>look_ahead</b>.
    </LI>
<LI><I>Chaiken's Algorithm</I> - "Inscribes" a line touching the original line such that the points on this new line
    are at least <I>threshold</I> apart. Input parameters: <B>input</B>, <B>threshold</B>. This algorithms
    approximates given line very well.</LI>
<LI> <I>Hermite Interpolation</I> - This algorithm takes the points of the given line as the control
     points of hermite cubic spline and approximates this spline by the points approximatelly <B>threshold</B> apart.
     This method has excellent results for the small values of <B>threshold</B>, but in this case it produces
     a huge number of new points and some simplification is usually needed. Input parameters: <B>input</B>, <B>threshold</B>.</LI>
<LI> <I>Snakes</I> is the method of minimization of the "energy" of the line. This method preserves the
     general characteristcs of the lines but smooths the "sharp corners" of the line. Input parameters <B>input</B>, <B>alfa</B>, <B>beta</B>.
     This algorithm works very well for small values of <B>alfa</B> and <B>beta</B> (between 0 and 5). These
     parameters affects the "sharpness" and the curvature of the computed line.</LI>                          
</UL>
</P>
<P>
One of the key advantages of <I>Hermite Interpolation</I> is the fact that the computed line
always passes throught the points of the original line whereas the lines produced by the 
remaining algorithms never pass through these points. In some sense, this algorihtm outputs
the line which "circumsrcibes" given line. On the other hand, <I>Chaiken's Algorithm</I> outputs
the line which "inscribes" given line. Moreover this line always touches/intersects the centre
of the line segment between two consecutive points. For many iterations, the property above does
not hold, but the computed lines are very similar to the Bezier Splines. The disadvantage of these
two algorithm is that they increase the number of point.
</P>
<P>
Note that <I>Boyle's</I>, <I>McMaster's</I> and <I>Snakes</I> algorithm are sometime used in the signal processing to smooth the signals.
More importantly, these algorithms never change the number of points on the lines. i.e they only
translate the points around, they do not insert any new points.
