<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

Recently, graph-theory has been characterised as an efficient and useful tool for conservation planning (e.g. Bunn et al. 2000, Calabrese & Fagan 2004, Minor et al. 2008, Zetterberg et. al. 2010). As a part of the r.connectivity.* tool-chain, r.connectivity.distance is intended to make graph-theory more easily available to conservation planning.
<br><br>
r.connectivity.distance is the first tool of the r.connectivity.*-toolchain (followed by r.connectivity.network and r.connectivity.corridor).
<br><br>
r.connectivity.distance loops through all polygons in the input vector map and calculates the cost-distance to all the other polygons within a user-defined defined Euclidean distance threshold. It produces three csv-files containing an edge-list (connections between patches) and a vertex-list (patches) in two parts.
<br><br>
The edge-list csv-file structure (edges.csv) looks like this:
<dl>
<dd><em><b>from_patch,to_patch,cost-distance</b></em></dd>
<dd><em>1;2;150</em></dd>
<dd><em>1;3;75</em></dd>
<dd><em>...</em></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
The vertex-list consists of two parts:
<dd>-  one part containing the coordinates of the centroids of the input polygons (only for visualisation purposes (not for analysis) ("vertices_part_1.csv") and</dd>
<dd>-  one part containing a population proxy (values of an attribute column from the input patch vector map (both specified by the user)), representing a proxy for the amount of organisms potentially dispersing from a patch (e.g. habitat area) ("vertices_part_2.csv").</dd>
</dl><br>
The structure of the vertices_part_1.csv looks like this:
<dl>
<dd><em><b>patch_id;cetroid_x_coordinate;cetroid_y_coordinate</b></em></dd>
<dd><em>1;796973.455617378;7874304.58988322</em></dd>
<dd><em>2;1028575.90731092;7909142.41545215</em></dd>
<dd><em>...</em></dd>
</dl>
<br>
The structure of the vertices_part_2.csv looks like this:
<dl>
<dd><em><b>patch_id;population_proxy</b></em></dd>
<dd><em>1;20.7652</em></dd>
<dd><em>2;74.0114</em></dd>
<dd><em>...</em></dd>
</dl>
<br>
The map output of r.connectivity.distance is a (cost) distance raster map for every input polygon which later on are used in r.connectivity.corridors (together with output from r.connectivity.network) for corridor identification. All non map output is stored in a folder, which will be used throughout the entire r.connectivity toolchain. Output-files are: vertices_part_1.csv, vertices_part_2.csv, edges.csv and a log-file (r_connectivity.log). The log-file is used to store and document settings of the tools and to pass arguments to the following tools of the toolchain.
<br><br>
Distance is measured as border to border distance. The user can define the number of cells (n) along the border to be used for distance measuring. The distance from a (start) polygon to another (end) is measured as the n-th closest cell on the border of the other (end) polygon. An increased number of border cells used for distance measuring affects (increases) also the width of possible corridors computed with r.connectivity.corridor.
