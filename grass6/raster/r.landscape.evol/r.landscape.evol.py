    # This step calculates the force of the flowing water at every cell on the landscape using the proper transport process law for the specific point in the flow regime. For upper hillslopes (below cutoff point 1) this done by multiplying the diffusion coeficient by the accumulated flow/cell res width. For midslopes (between cutoff 1 and 2) this is done by multiplying slope by accumulated flow with the m and n exponents set to 1. For channel catchment heads (between cutoff 2 and 3), this is done by multiplying slope by accumulated flow with the m and n exponents set to 1.6 and 1.3 respectively. For Channelized flow in streams (above cutoff 3), this is done by calculating the reach average shear stress (hydraulic radius [here estimated for a cellular landscape simply as the depth of flow]  times  slope times accumulated flow [cells] times gravitatiopnal acceleration of water [9806.65 newtons], all raised to the appropriate exponant for the type of transport (bedload or suspended load), and then divided by the resolution. Depth of flow is calculated as a mean "instantaneous depth" during any given rain event, here estimated by the maximum depth of an idealized unit hydrograph with base equal to the duration of the storm, and area equal to the total accumulated excess rainfall during the storm. Then finally calculates the stream power or sediment carrying capacity (qs) of the water flowing at each part of the map by multiplying the reach average shear stress (channelized flow in streams) or the estimated flow force (overland flow) by the transport coeficient (estimated by R*K*C for hillslopes or kt for streams). This is a "Transport Limited" equation, however, we add some constraints on detachment by checking to see if the sediment supply has been exhausted: if the current soil depth is 0 or negative (checking for a negative value is kind of an error trap) then we make the transport coefficient small (0.000001) to simulate erosion on bedrock. Because diffusion and USPED require 2D divergence later on, we calculate these as vectors in the X and Y directions. Stream flow only needs 1D difference, so it's calulated in the direction of flow.

    #Here is where we figure out the change in transport capacity, and thus the actual amount of erosion an deposition that would occur. There are two ways of doing this. On planar and convex surfaces (i.e., ridgetops, flats, hillslopes), it is better to take the 2D divergence of sediment flux (we use r.slope.aspect to calculate this), but on highly convex surfaces (i.e., in channels) it is better to take the 1D difference between one cell, and the cell that is immediately downstream from it. This all assumes that the system is always operating at Transport Capacity, or if it is not, then is still behaves as if it were (ie., that the actual differences in transported sediment between the cells would be proportional to the system operating at capacity). Thus, under this assumption, the divergence of capacity is equals to actual amount of sediment eroded/deposited.
    #This is the way we implemnt this: First calculate, we calculate the divergence/differnce for EACH of the different flow processes on the ENTIRE map (i.e., make one map per process, difference for streams, divergence for USPED and diffusion). Then, we cut out the pieces of each of these maps that correspond to the correct landforms from each specific process (based on the user-input cutoffs in flow accumulation), and patch them together into a single map (NOTE: see output unit conversions section below to see how we get all the units to line up during this process). This counters the "boundary effect" that happens when running the differential equations for divergence across the boundary of two different flow processes.  Then we may still have to run a median smoother on the patched map to get rid of any latent spikes.
