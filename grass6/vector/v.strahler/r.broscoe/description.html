<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.broscoe.sh</em> Calculates waerden test and t test statistics for some values of threshold area on a single basin, according to A.J.Broscoe theory (1959).<br />
The program uses some <em><a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a></em> commands for statistical analisys and graphic rapresentation. In particoular the R package <em>"agricolae"</em> is required.<br />
The A.J.Broscoe theory is well known as the theory of the "Mean Stream Drop" and it says that, for the extraction by DEM of a stream network, exists a threshold value wich makes <em>drop</em> constant, and this is the <em>right</em> one extraction threshold. <br />
By definig the <em>drop</em> (H) as:<br />
<br />
<em>H = S L</em><br />
<br />
for streams in each Strahler order. <br />
The <em>drop</em> is calculated as the quote difference by ending and starting point of a stream; S is the slope and L is the lenght of the same stream.<br />
Using the Leopold and Miller relation (1964):<br />
<br />
<em>S=CA<sup>t</sup></em><br />
<br />
where C and t are constat values; the area we are searching (A) is the lowest that gives S to find H costant for each Strahler order (w).<br />
<br />
<em>H<sub>w</sub> = H<sub>w+1</sub> = H<sub>w+2</sub> = ...</em><br />
<br />
where H<sub>w</sub> is the <em>mean</em> of the drops related to the streams in the same Strahler order (w).<br />
The area can be found by making some attempts for different area thresholds, doing some statistical tests (Van der Waerden test and linear regression), and choosing the <em>right</em> threshold from the output of the tests.<br />
<br />
<em>r.broscoe.sh</em> takes in input the DEM, the threshold values on wich calculate statistics, the outlet coords of the basin you want to study; it returns a table (text file) with the output of the Van der Waerden test and linear regression (t test) for each threshold value.<br />
For the Van der Waerden test the parameter <em>Pvalue</em> is taken. It has to be greater than the possible, it represents the possibility of success of the test (the <em>Mean Stream Drop</em> is the same for all Strahler orders).<br />
For the linear regression the parameters <em>t, Pr, R_squared_adj</em> are taken. <em>t</em> is the t statistic value, <em>Pr</em> is the possibility of success of the t test, <em>R_squared_adj</em> measures the dispersion of data around the mean value (for each order) for given degrees of freedom.<br />
Three graphics called "linear_regression", "waerden_test" and "all_tests" are also generated as PDF in the home folder.<br />
<br />
Preferably let's take the threshold value wich gives <em>Pvalue</em> (or <em>Pr</em>) greater than 0.95, but is not granted that you can reach that result because it depends of the well-graduation (by Horton-Strahler) of the basin, its geomorphological maturity, so it is not rare that you have to take threshold where <em>Pvalue</em> is simlpy the greatest.<br />
At the end of the calculation, at first <em>Pvalue</em> is examinated, then, only if Van der Waerden test gives no good results (low <em>Pvalue</em>), the linear regression output (<em>Pr</em>) is examinated; in fact the Van der Waerden test is preferred to linear regression because it allows you to consider the real dispersion of data around the mean: this makes you able to know the real significance of the probability (e.g. the significance is low for few data in the sample) considering an unique parameter.<br />

<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>

An example on Menotre stream (Umbria, Italy):<br />
The syntax:

<div class="code"><pre>
  r.broscoe.sh dem=dtm20_regione@AB 'thresholds=400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1800 2000' xcoor=2291350.34 ycoor=4765192.22 lt=4 result=menotre_txt
</pre></div>

The results:
<div class="code"><pre>
threshold	t	Pr	Radj	Pvalue
400	0.5713518	0.568486	-0.003798402	0.6085511

<br />
By the report and graphics, you can see that the Van der Werden test gives not-so-good results (<em>Pvalue_max</em>=0.85 for threshold=1000 cells) but, if you consider the linear regression output (<em>Pr</em>), you can see that for the same threshold value (1000 cells) <em>Pr</em> is 97%.<br />
So the threshold=1000 cells is chosen. Moreover the program returns a set of vector map called <em>"orderd_thresholdvalue"</em> from wich you can extract the right one orderd-network (in this case the right one is <em>"orderd_1000"</em>), you can rename and use it as well as you want.<br />

<h2>NOTES</h2>
The <em>lt</em> value requested in input is a parameter that prevents eventual errors in the DEM; it considers the presence of pits and represents the height difference <em>lesserthan</em> a drop is not considered as a drop but as a pit, and extracted from <em>Mean Stream Drop</em> analysis.<br />
<br />
The program uses the module <em><a href="r.strahler.html">r.strahler</a></em>, so it presents the same conditions about the selection of a threshold value range.<br />
