<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.in.gshhs</em> imports GSHHS shorelines as available on
<a href="http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/wessel/gshhs/">http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/wessel/gshhs/</a>

<p>
GSHHS shorelines are in latlon but can be imported to any location with 
any projection apart from unreferenced XY projection. Reprojection is 
done on the fly during import.

<p>
Shorelines are imported as lines, not boundaries.

<p>
The categories in layer 1 refer to the type of shoreline: 1 = land, 
2 = lake, 3 = island in lake, 4 = pond in island in lake. The field
<tt>type</tt> is set to these descriptions. All lines of the same type
have the same category. The categories in layer 2 refer to the GSHHS ID
of each imported line. Each line has as category value the GSHHS ID in 
layer 2, that may be useful for further processing. An attribute table 
for layer 2 is not created.

<p>
The -r flag restricts the import to the current region, otherwise the 
full dataset is imported. With the -r flag, any line that falls into or
overlaps with the current region is imported. Lines are not cropped.

<p>
As of July 2012 GSHHS has been renamed GSHHG, as they provide more than
just shorelines.


<h2>NOTES</h2>

The GSHHS shorelines are in files named <tt>gshhs_[f|h|i|l|c].b</tt> where 
the letter in brackets indicates the resolution.

<p>
The 5 available resolutions are:
<ul>
<li>f: full resolution
<li>h: high resolution
<li>i: intermediate resolution
<li>l: low resolution
<li>c: coarse resolution
</ul>
Recommended are the full and high resolution data.
<p>
The generated table for layer 1 allows a fast query of the shoreline type.
If needed, a table for layer 2 can be added with <em>v.db.addtable</em>. 
The new table can be populated with category values from layer 2 (GSHHS
line ID) with <em>v.to.db</em>. Shoreline type can be uploaded from 
layer 1 to layer 2 with <em>v.to.db</em>.
<p>
Lines can be converted to boundaries with <em>v.type</em>.
Boundaries can be converted to areas with <em>v.centroids</em>.
<p>
To create a land mask, extract all lines with category = 1 in layer 1,
convert them to boundaries, add missing centroids, convert area vector
to raster. Accordingly for lakes, islands in lakes, and ponds in islands
in lakes.
<p>
Import of world borders and world rivers also included in the zip archive
is currently not supported but works, just ignore the attribute table.
These world borders and rivers may be not very accurate.
