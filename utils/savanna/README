savanna is designed to distribute GRASS raster commands across a sun gridengine ("SGE") cluster.
	The name "savanna" refers to the fact that we are creating a field of GRASS to solve our
	raster problem.

Overview:
savanna takes a raster command and a region setting, and runs through these steps to distribute
	the process across a gridengine cluster:
1) Initialization: savanna creates a "grid" of polygons which represent the boundaries of each tile
	which will be processed.  This grid is based on the tile size, the overlap size, and the extent
	of the g.region.
2) Tiling: each tile is processed as a SGE job using GRASS's batch mode and g.regions set to the
	tile extents.
3) Copying: each output tile is then cropped (if there is an overlap) and copied back into a central directory.
4) Mosaic: all of the output tiles are then mosaicked back into a single image.
5) [TODO]: Once the process has been successfully run, the temporary tile mapsets/files are cleaned up.

Usage:
[COMING SOON]

Configuring global parameters:
Edit the "savanna_global_parameters.sh" file to fit your local installation.

savanna_path: the full path to the savanna*.sh files (where you are probably reading this README)
savanna_tmp: a path to the temporary outputs of savanna (this is where the output and error logfiles
	are stored of the run, so its a good place to check to see how the process is proceding and for
	troubleshooting.
gridengine_settings: this is the full path to the gridengine "settings.sh" file.  Your local admin
	should know where this is, if gridengine is installed and running.  A standard install would be
	something like "/pathto/ge6.2u5/default/common/settings.sh"

Configuring savanna parameter file:
[this will be a command line argument via getopts eventually, right now you have to edit savanna.sh to the
	parameter file.]
Important: DON'T FORGET THE @mapset -- this scripts launches externally to GRASS, so it has no idea
	what mapset you want to use.
Note the use of \ if you need to continue to the next line.

grassdata_directory: the full path to your grass datra directory, e.g.:
	grassdata_directory='/pathto/grass'
base_location: the location the savanna run will be performed in, e.g.:
	base_location='savanna_location'
gregion: this needs to be a properly formatted g.region statement using rast=raster@mapset, example:
	"g.region rast=savanna_test@savanna_test_mapset"
command: a properly formatted r.* command that outputs raster files of the same extent as the input, example:
	"r.slope.aspect elevation=savanna_test@savanna_test_mapset \
	slope=savanna_test_slope \
	aspect=savanna_test_aspect \
	format=degrees prec=float zfactor=1.0 min_slp_allowed=0.0"
outputs: this needs to be the output of the raster statement; use wildcards if need be.  Without this, savanna
	can't perform the copy and mosaic phases (it has no idea what the outputs of your command are).  Example:
	outputs="savanna_test_*"
tilexsize and tileysize: these are the requested tile sizes per gridengine job.  The idea is to get these tiles small
	enough to keep the memory footprint low, while not excessively small so that there is a lot of overhead during
	the copy/mosaic phases. Example:
	tilexsize=500
	tileysize=500
tileoverlap: if your process requires some level of local neighborhood (e.g. slope and aspect), you need to set an overlap
	between tiles, otherwise you will have seamlines resulting.  Set this depending on your particular process (straight
	raster algebra via mapcalc, for instance, could have the overlap set to 0.
	tileoverlap=10
mask: UNUSED RIGHT NOW

TODO:
Lots of error checking.
Better command line interface.
Include example raster.
Cleanup.
