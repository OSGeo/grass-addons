<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>g.rename.many</em> renames multiple maps at once using
<em><a href="g.rename.html">g.rename</a></em> module.
Old and new names are read from a text file.
The file format is a simple CSV (comma separated values) format
with no text delimiter (e.g. no quotes around cell content).
Comma is a default cell delimiter but it can be changed to anything.

<p>
Possible use cases include:
    <ul>
        <li>
            renaming maps named in a certain language to English
            when data were obtained at national level but the futher
            collaboration is international
        </li>
        <li>
            renaming provided sample maps with English names to
            a national language for educational purposes in case
            English is not appropriate
        </li>
        <li>
            preparation of a
            <a href="http://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/GRASS_GIS_Standardized_Sample_Datasets">
            GRASS GIS Standardized Sample Dataset</a> which requires
            a certain set of standardized names
        </li>
    </ul>


<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>

<h3>Renaming rasters</h3>

First prepare a file with names of raster maps to be renamed.
The file can be prepared in spreadsheet application
(and saved as CSV with cell delimiter comma and no text delimiter)
or as a text file in any (plain) text editor.
In any case, the result should be a plain text file with format and
content similar to the following sample:

<div class="code"><pre>
landuse96_28m,landuse
geology_30m,geology
soilsID,soils
</pre></div>

Once the file is prepared, the module can be called:

<div class="code"><pre>
g.rename.many raster=raster_names.csv
</pre></div>

<p>
This example worked only with raster maps. However multiple files, one
for each map type, can be used at once.


<h3>Creating a file with current names</h3>

A template for renaming can be prepared using
<em><a href="g.list.html">g.list</a></em> module,
for example in command line (bash syntax):

<div class="code"><pre>
g.list type=raster mapset=. sep=",
" &gt; raster_names.csv
</pre></div>

<p>
Note that we are using only maps in a current Mapset because these
are the only ones we can rename.

<p>
With some further processing file template can be made more complete
by including map names twice (bash syntax):

<div class="code"><pre>
g.list type=raster mapset=. | sed -e "s/\(.*\)/\1,\1/g" &gt; raster_names.csv
</pre></div>

The <em>sed</em> expression used here takes whatever is on a line
on input and puts it twice on one line on the output separated by comma.
