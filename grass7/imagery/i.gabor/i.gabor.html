<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>
<em>i.gabor</em> computes texture raster maps from a user-specified Gabor
filter bank and raster map.
The 2 dimensional Gabor filter is an orientation sensitive filter which mimics
the cells within the human visual cortex.

<p>
The default orientations computed will be 0 (East/West), 45
(North-East/South-West), 90 North/South, 135 (North-West/South-East).
However, the user can also specify any number of orientations in degrees less
than 180 with the <b>orientation</b> option.
The window size of the Gabor filter is specified by the user in
<em>i.gabor</em>
The standard deviation of the Gaussian kernel before it is oscilated is tied to
the user-specified window size.
<p>
The Gabor filter has both a real and imaginary component which can be used for
different purposes.
While <em>i.gabor</em> computes the real component by default, the imaginary
component can be computed by using the flag <b>-i</b>.

<p>
By default <em>i.gabor</em> outputs each Gabor filter convolved raster map as
individual raster maps with the prefix of <i>windowsize_orientation_wavelength_
offset_aspect</i> with each part corresponding to its specified value.
The <b>-c</b> flag can be used to create a singular combined raster map as the
output.
<p>
Additionally, <em>i.gabor</em> offers statistical thresholding which will set values below a
user-specified percentile (<b>threshold</b>) of the to 0 while keeping all
values above the percentile the same.
In conjunction with thresholding, a bitwise quantification (<b>-q</b>) method
is implemented for the orientations specified by the user.

<h2>NOTES</h2>
As an orientation sensitive filter, the Gabor filter is unique in its
capabilities to mimic the human visual cortex system when a bank of Gabor filters is used.
Common filter banks will consist of between 4 to 8 orientations and scales
controlled by the wavelength.
Each filter within a bank is subsequently convolved over the raster map for
each kernel within the bank.
The resulting number of raster maps will be the number of orientations x the
number of scales.
The Gabor filter has been used in hyperspectral image classification, water
body and river extraction, land use classification and change detection,
and Object Based Image Analysis (OBIA) algorithms.

<h3>Orientation quantification</h3>
The orientation quantificatation takes the index value (<i>i</i>) of each
user-specified orientation and applies <i>2<sup>i</sup></i> for every value greater than
or equal to the percentile value.
Where a bit string position is equal to one it indicates the corresponding
orientation<i><sub>i</sub></i> has a strong response.
<div class="code"><pre>
orientation = 0, 45, 90, 135
0   = 0b00000001 = 1
45  = 0b00000010 = 2
90  = 0b00000100 = 4
135 = 0b00001000 = 8
</pre></div>
This method will allow the values of the combined raster to be decomposed in
order to evaluate which orientations had high responses for a given raster cell.
I.e. if a cell has high responses at orientations 0 and 135 degrees, the
combined raster cell will have a final output value of 9, which as a binary
string is <i>0b00001001</i>.

<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>
The following example uses the North Carolina demo data orthophoto.
Eight orientations are used; 0, 22.5, 45, 67.5, 90, 112.5, 135, and 157.5
degrees.
For the quantified raster map, the bit values will be 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64,
and 256.
