<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>i.superpixels.slic</em> performs superpixel segmentation using a 
k means method. The number of superpixels is determined either with the 
<b>k</b> option (number of superpixels) or with the <b>step</b> option 
(distance between initial super pixel centers).
<p>
The <b>compactness</b> option controls the compactness of the resulting 
superpixels. A larger <b>compactness</b> value will cause spatially more 
compact, but spectrally more heterogeneous superpixels. This is 
the most important parameter of the module. A reasonable value should 
be determined for small test regions before applying the module to a 
large region.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

<h4>Iterations</h4>
In each iteration, the assignment of pixels to superpixels and the 
superpixels themselves (spatial and spectral means) are updated until 
either the maximum number of iterations is reached or until the 
superpixels no longer change. More iterations will provide better 
results but will increase processing time. The module will stop earlier 
if convergence is reached, but it can take 1000 or more iterations 
until convergence is reached.

<h4>Minimum clump size</h4>
If a minimum segment size of 2 or larger is given with the <b>minsize</b> 
parameter, segments with a smaller pixel count will be merged with 
their most similar neighbor.

<h4>Creating seeds for <em>i.segment</em></h4>
If the purpose is to create seeds for <em>i.segment</em>, a small number 
of iterations (at least 10) should be sufficient. Further on, a large 
number of superpixels or a small step should be used, and small clumps 
should not be merged.

<h4>Image segmentation</h4>
If the purpose is to perform image segmentation with 
<em>i.superpixels.slic</em>, a larger number of iterations (e.g. 100) 
should be used in order to obtain more stable superpixels. In this 
case, larger superpixels can be used and small clumps can be removed 
with the <b>minsize</b> option.

<h4>Normalization of spectral distances (SLIC0)</h4>
If the <b>-n</b> flag is used, the spectral distance of a pixel to a 
given superpixel is divided by the maximum previously observed spectral 
distance to that superpixel. This is the so-called <em>SLIC0</em> (SLIC 
zero) method. After each iteration, the largest spectral distance to a 
superpixel is determined from all pixels assigned to that superpixel. 
In the next iteration, pixel assignment to superpixels is updated and 
spectral distances of pixels to superpixels are divided by the largest 
spectral distance of the current superpixel when evaluating a potential 
assignment of a pixel to a superpixel.
<p>
That means that more heterogeneous superpixels have a larger maximum 
spectral distance. For a given pixel, the normalized spectral distance 
will be smaller for a more heterogeneous superpixel than for a more 
homogeneous superpixel. This favours more heterogeneous superpixels 
which can steal pixels from more homogeneous superpixels even if the 
not normalized spectral distance of a pixel to a homogeneous superpixel 
is smaller than to a heterogeneous pixel. As a consequence, 
heterogeneous superpixels can become larger and and even more 
heterogeneous. This effect becomes stronger with larger differences in 
the spectral homogeneity of neighboring superpixels.
