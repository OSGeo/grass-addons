<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>i.superpixels.slic</em> performs superpixel segmentation using a 
k means method, based on the work of Achanta et al. 2010. (SLIC =
Simple Linear Iterative Clustering). The number of superpixels is
determined either with the  <b>num_pixels</b> option (number of
superpixels) or with the <b>step</b> option (distance between initial
super pixel centers).
<p>
The <b>compactness</b> option controls the compactness of the resulting 
superpixels. A larger <b>compactness</b> value will cause spatially more 
compact, but spectrally more heterogeneous superpixels. This is 
the most important parameter of the module. A reasonable value should 
be determined for small test regions before applying the module to a 
large region.
<p>
The resultant number of superpixels will most often be larger than the 
initial number of superpixels because the initial number of superpixels 
is used to create seeds and SLIC assigns pixels to seeds. Pixels 
assigned to the same seed are usually not connected. The final 
number of superpixels is the number of clumps, also known as 
connected components, objects, regions, or blobs. The final number of 
superpixels can be reduced with the <b>minsize</b> option.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

<h4>Input bands</h4>
Contrary to the original Achanta et al. SLIC algorithm which allows only
RGB input images (which are internally transformed into LAB color space, 
<em>i.superpixels.slic</em> allows the use of any number of input bands. 
These bands can be either spectral bands of imagery, or any other 
pseudo-bands relevant to the analysis at hand (NDVI, texture, 
precipitation, etc). All band values are normalized to a common 0-1 scale
to ensure comparability in the spectral distance calculations. 
Therefore results will not be identical with the original implementation.

<h4>Iterations</h4>
In each iteration, the assignment of pixels to superpixels and the 
superpixels themselves (spatial and spectral means) are updated until 
either the maximum number of iterations is reached or until the 
superpixels no longer change. More iterations will provide better 
results but will increase processing time. The module will stop earlier 
if convergence is reached, but it can take 1000 or more iterations 
until convergence is reached.

<h4>Step</h4>
Step size has to be larger than 1 to be meaningful, as otherwise each individual
pixel would be considered as a superpixel. If no step size or a step size of 
less than 2 given, the module estimates a step size internally on the basis of
the number of superpixels (<b>num_pixels</b> - 200 by default).

<h4>Minimum segment size</h4>
If a minimum segment size of 2 or larger is given with the <b>minsize</b> 
parameter, segments with a smaller pixel count will be merged with 
their most similar neighbor.
<p>
In the original implementation of Achanta et al., a minimum segment 
size is internally determined, and segments smaller than this minimum 
segment size are merged with an arbitrarily chosen neigbour. Therefore 
results will not be identical with the original implementation, even if 
a minimum segment size identical to the minimum segment size internally 
determined in the original implementation of Achanta et al. is used.

<h4>Creating seeds for <em>i.segment</em></h4>
If the purpose is to create seeds for <em>i.segment</em>, a small number 
of iterations (at least 10) should be sufficient. Further on, a large 
number of superpixels or a small step should be used, and small clumps 
should not be merged.

<h4>Image segmentation</h4>
If the purpose is to perform image segmentation with 
<em>i.superpixels.slic</em>, a larger number of iterations (e.g. 100) 
should be used in order to obtain more stable superpixels. In this 
case, larger superpixels can be used and small clumps can be removed 
with the <b>minsize</b> option.

<h4>Normalization of spectral distances (SLIC0)</h4>
If the <b>-n</b> flag is used, the spectral distance of a pixel to a 
given superpixel is divided by the maximum previously observed spectral 
distance to that superpixel. This is an adaptation of the so-called 
<em>SLIC0</em> (SLIC zero) method. 
<p>
After each iteration, the largest spectral distance to a 
superpixel is determined from all pixels assigned to that superpixel. 
In the next iteration, pixel assignment to superpixels is updated and 
spectral distances of pixels to superpixels are divided by the largest 
spectral distance of the current superpixel when evaluating a potential 
assignment of a pixel to a superpixel.
<p>
Contrary to the Achanta et al. version of SLIC0, <em>i.superpixels.slic</em>
takes into account the <em>compactness</em> value chosen by the user even
when the <b>-n</b> flag is used.
<p>
SLIC0 implies that more heterogeneous superpixels have a larger maximum 
spectral distance. For a given pixel, the normalized spectral distance 
will be smaller for a more heterogeneous superpixel than for a more 
homogeneous superpixel. This favours more heterogeneous superpixels 
which can steal pixels from more homogeneous superpixels even if the 
not normalized spectral distance of a pixel to a homogeneous superpixel 
is smaller than to a heterogeneous pixel. As a consequence, 
heterogeneous superpixels can become larger and and even more 
heterogeneous. This effect becomes stronger with larger differences in 
the spectral homogeneity of neighboring superpixels, and with a lower
<em>compactness</em> value, as spectral difference then gets a bigger weight.

<h4>Perturbing initial superpixel centers</h4>
Initial superpixel centers can be optimized with the <b>perturb</b> 
option. The objective of this optimization of initial superpixel 
centers is to create more distinct and more homogeneous superpixels. 
Superpixel centers are shifted to more uniform areas, the 
pixel with the smallest gradient. The module guarantees that no two 
superpixel centers are shifted to the same position. The <b>perturb</b> 
option is interpreted as percent of the maximum allowable shift 
distance such that no two superpixel centers can obtain the same 
position.

<h4>Memory vs disk cache</h4>
<em>i.superpixels.slic</em> can handle very large amounts of data. Depending 
on the amount of data and the available RAM memory, as defined by the 
<em>memory</em> parameter, the module will either work with memory cache,
storing everything in memory, or with a disk cache, storing elements on disk
and only retrieving the data when necessary. Disk cache is slower, but the data
can be much larger than the RAM memory can hold. By default, the 
<em>memory</em> parameter is set fairly low for modern computer systems 
(500MB). Users should thus make sure to adjust the value to their system.

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

<h3>Segmentation of Landsat images and NDVI</h3>

List Landsat imagery in the full NC sample dataset:

<div class="code"><pre>
g.list type=raster pattern='lsat*' sep=comma mapset=PERMANENT
</pre></div>

Set the computation region to one of the rasters (all have the same
extent and resolution):

<div class="code"><pre>
g.region raster=lsat7_2002_10 -p
</pre></div>

Use the list to create an imagery group:

<div class="code"><pre>
i.group group=lsat subgroup=lsat input=`g.list type=raster pattern='lsat*' sep=comma mapset=PERMANENT`
</pre></div>

Perform the segmentation:

<div class="code"><pre>
i.superpixels.slic input=lsat output=segments num_pixels=2000
</pre></div>

Convert the segments to vectors for further analysis and visualization:

<div class="code"><pre>
r.to.vect input=segments output=segments type=area
</pre></div>

Show the boundaries between the segments with false color image
in the background:

<div class="code"><pre>
d.rgb red=lsat7_2002_70 green=lsat7_2002_50 blue=lsat7_2002_30
d.vect map=segments fill_color=none
</pre></div>

Let's compute the NDVI using <em><a href="r.mapcalc.html">r.mapcalc</a></em>
and assign average NDVI to each of the vector areas:

<div class="code"><pre>
i.vi red=lsat7_2002_30 nir=lsat7_2002_40 viname=ndvi output=ndvi
v.rast.stats map=segments raster=ndvi column_prefix=ndvi method=average
</pre></div>

And now visualize the segments using the NDVI value for coloring the
areas with the <tt>ndvi</tt> color table but keeping the area boundaries
black:

<div class="code"><pre>
g.copy vector=segments,segments_color
v.colors map=segments_color use=attr column=ndvi_average color=ndvi
d.vect map=segments_color width=2 icon=basic/point
d.vect map=segments fill_color=none
</pre></div>
