<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>i.cutlines</em> tiles the images into tiles with irregular borders that
avoid cutting through meaningful objects. This allows tiling an image for
parallel processing while avoiding border effects.

<p>
The approach used in <em>i.cutlines</em> is inspired by Soares et al (2016).
The module first uses an edge detection algorithm (which the user can chose 
with the <b>edge_detection</b> parameter) to identify edges in the image. It
then uses <a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/r.cost.html">r.cost</a>
and <a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/r.drain">r.drain</a> to
draw lines through the image, following edges when possible and going straight
when there are none.

<p>
The user can determine the number of lines desired (<b>number_lines</b>) in each
direction and the friction associated with pixels which are not on an edge
detected in the image (<b>no_edge_friction</b>). The higher this value, the
more the module will follow the detected edges.

<p>
In order to avoid that all lines gather into one single lowest cost path, the
module defines a lane for each desired line. The parameter
<b>lane_border_multiplier</b> defines the a multiplier of the
<b>no_edge_friction</b> value, in order to define the cost to 
cross that line, i.e. the lower the value, the more likely cutlines will join 
each other across lanes. Output is in the form of vector polygon tiles. The user
can decide a minimum size defined in map units (<b>min_tile_size</b>). Tiles 
smaller than that size will be merged with the neighboring tile they share the 
longest border with.

<p>
The user can provide a series of auxiliary vector maps which contain existing
cutlines (roads, boundaries, etc) that the module should take into account
(<b>existing_cutlines</b>). These can be either lines or polygons. The module
will transform all to potential cutlines.

<p>
For edge detection the user can chose between the <a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/i.zc.html">i.zc</a>
module or the <a href="i.edge.html">i.edge</a> addon. For the former, the user
can determine the <b>zc_threshold</b> and the <b>zc_width</b> parameters. For
the latter, the <b>canny_low_threshold</b>, <b>canny_high_threshold</b> and
<b>canny_sigma</b> parameters. See the manual page of the respective modules
for details about these parameters which might need tuning to fit to the 
specific image. As these modules read the entire image into RAM, 
<em>i.cutlines</em> allows the user to run split the image into rectangular 
tiles and to process each tile separately. Tiles can be defined with the 
<b>tile_width</b>, <b>tile_height</b> and <b>overlap</b> parameters. If 
<b>processes</b> is higher than one, these tiles will be processed in parallel
as will the <a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/r.cost.html">r.cost</a> calls for the two directions.

<p>
The <b>memory</b> parameter determines the memory used both for the 
<a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/r.cost.html">r.cost</a> runs.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

Until GRASS GIS version 7.4 included, there was a parameter name conflict between
<a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/i.zc.html">i.zc</a> and the
GridModule class in pygrass. For older GRASS GIS versions tiled edge 
detection is thus only possible with <a href="i.edge.html">i.edge</a>.

<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>

Using default <a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/i.zc.html">i.zc</a> edge detection without tiling, 
default parameters and 10 horizontal and 10 vertical cutlines, creating
vector polygon output:

<div class="code"><pre> 
g.region rast=ortho_2001_t792_1m -p
i.cutlines ortho_2001_t792_1m number_lines=10 output=ortho_tiles 
</pre></div>
