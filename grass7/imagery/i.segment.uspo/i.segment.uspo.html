<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p><em>i.segment.uspo</em> provides unsupervised segmentation parameter
optimization for <em><a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/i.segment.html">i.segment</a></em> determined
by the compromise between intra-segment variance and inter-segment spatial 
autocorrelation.


<p>
The module runs segmentation across a user defined set of thresholds and minimum
segment sizes, as well, for the mean shift algorithm, a set of spectral and 
spatial bandwiths. For the mean shift algorithm, you can also activate adaptive 
bandwidth using the <em>-a</em> flag.

<p>The user provides an imagery <b>group</b> and the name of an <b>output</b>
text file where parameter and optimization values for all tested segmentations
are stored. The user can either give a list of thresholds and minimum sizes, or
provides start, stop and step values for each. In addition, the user can provide
a list of named <b>regions</b> for which to test the segmentation.  This allows
to not test the entire image, but rather to test specific areas in the image
that might be characterstic for specific types of land cover.

<p>The module then selects the parameters providing the highest values of a
given optimization function. The number of "best" parameter combinations to 
provide to the user per <b>region</b> is defined by <b>number_best</b>.

<p>Two optimization functions are available via the <b>optimization_function</b>
parameter: A simple sum of the normalized criteria values as defined by
Espindola et al (2006), or the F-function as defined by Johnson et al (2015). 
When using the F-function, the user can determine the <b>f_function_alpha</b> 
value which determines the relative weight of the intra-segment variance as
compared to the inter-segment spatial autocorrelation. A value of 0.5 gives
the former half weight of the latter, A value of 2 gives the former double
weight than the latter.
	
<p>
The optimization functions use intra-segment variance and inter-segment spatial
autocorrelation. For the latter, the user can chose to use either <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moran%27s_I">Moran's I</a> or <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geary%27s_C">Geary's C</a>. 

<p>The user can chose between non-hierarchical (default) and hierarchical 
segmentation using the <b>h</b> flag. The latter uses each segmentation at a 
given threshold level as seed for the segmentation at the next threshold level
within a given minimum segment size. Note that this leads to less optimal
parallelization as for a given minsize, all segmentations have to be done
sequentially (see below).

<p>The <b>segment_map</b> parameter allows to provide a
basename for keeping the <b>number_best</b> best segmentations for each given
<b>region</b> according to the optimization function. The resulting map names
will be a combination of this basename, the region, the threshold, the
minsize and the rank of the map within the region according to its optimization
criteria value.

<p> The module uses high-level parallelization (running different segmentations
in parallel and then running the collection of parameter values in parallel).
The parameter <b>processes</b> allows to define how many processes should be run
in parallel. Note that when using hierarchical segmentation the number of parallel 
processes is limited to the number of different mininum segment sizes to test.

<p> The <b>k</b> flag allows to keep all segmentation maps created during the
process.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

<p>
The module depends on the addon <a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/addons/r.neighborhoodmatrix.html">r.neighborhoodmatrix</a>
which needs to be installed.

<p> Any unsupervised optimization can at best be a support to the user.  Visual
and other types of validation of the results, possibly comparing several of the
"best" solutions, remain necessary.

<p> Even though the module allows the user to test different <em>minsizes</em>,
it is probably better to run the module with minsizes=1 and then adapt the 
minsize in the final run of <a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/i.segment.html">i.segment</a> depending 
on the desired minimum mapping unit.

<p> In hierarchical segmentation mode, each segmentation is used as seed for 
the next hierarchical level. This means that these segmentations have to be
run sequentially. Currently, parallelization is thus only used if more than one
value was given for <em>minsize</em>. In a future version, parallelization 
should optionally be run by region if the number of regions is larger than
the number of different <em>minsize</em> values.
