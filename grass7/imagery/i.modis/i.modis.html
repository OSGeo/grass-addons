<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

The <em>i.modis</em> suite is a toolset to import MODIS (Moderate
Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, flown on the two NASA spacecrafts
Terra and Aqua) satellite data into GRASS GIS. It uses the
<a href="http://www.pymodis.org">pyModis</a> library and additionally
either the <a href="http://gdal.org/">GDAL library</a> or the
<a href="https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/tools/modis_reprojection_tool">MODIS Reprojection Tool</a> (MRT)
software to convert, mosaic and process MODIS data.
<p>
The <em>i.modis</em> suite requires the pyModis library and either the GDAL or MRT
software to be installed.
<p>
The <em>i.modis</em> suite offers two modules as interface to MODIS data. Each module
is dedicated to a specific operation. The module <em>i.modis.download</em>
is used to download MODIS HDF products from NASA servers. These files can then
be imported with <em>i.modis.import</em> which supports import of Level 3
MODIS products as a single image or as a mosaic into GRASS GIS.
<p>
Subsequently, the user can create a temporal dataset using <em>t.create</em> and, register
the maps with <em>t.register</em>. NOTE: In order to work with the temporal framework of
GRASS GIS the flag <em>w</em> must be set during the import with <em>i.modis.import</em>.
<p>
The user can choose from several MODIS products, distributed as single or multiple tiles
and also ranges of observation days retrieving data from the related NASA servers.
<!--
The suite process Level 2 data using the <em>i.modis.process</em> module.
-->
The suite imports Level 3 (georeferenced) products either as single images or as mosaics for
each date.

<h2>Supported MODIS products</h2>
These products are currently supported:

<h3>MODIS LST - Land Surface Temperature</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Land Surface Temperature daily 1 Km (Terra/Aqua)</b>: product provides per-pixel temperature
      and emissivity values in a sequence of swath-based to grid-based global products in Sinusoidal projection.
      The MODIS/Terra-Aqua LST/E Daily L3 Global 1 km Grid product (MOD11A1/MYD11A1), is tile-based
      and gridded in the Sinusoidal projection, and produced daily at 1 km spatial resolution.
      (related <a href="https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/dataset_discovery/modis/modis_products_table/mod11a1_v006">MOD11A1</a> and
      <a href="https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/dataset_discovery/modis/modis_products_table/myd11a1_v006">MYD11A1</a> 
      product pages)</li>
  <li><b>Land Surface Temperature eight day 1 Km (Terra/Aqua)</b>: data are composed from the daily
      1-kilometer LST product (MOD11A1/MYD11A1) and stored on a 1-km Sinusoidal grid as the
      average values of clear-sky LSTs during an 8-day period.<br>
      MOD11A2/MYD11A2 is comprised of daytime and nighttime LSTs, quality assessment,
      observation times, view angles, bits of clear sky days and nights, and
      emissivities estimated in Bands 31 and 32 from land cover types

  <li><b>Land Surface Temperature eight day ~6 Km (Terra/Aqua)</b>: products provide per-pixel
      temperature and emissivity values in a sequence of swath-based to grid-based
      global products. The MODIS/Terra-Aqua LST/E Daily L3 Global 6 Km Grid
      (Short name: MOD11B1/MYD11B1), is tile-based and gridded in the Sinusoidal projection,
      and produced daily at 5600m spatial resolution

<h3>MODIS VI - Vegetation Indices</h3>

<ul>
  <li><b>VI sixteen days 250 m (Terra/Aqua)</b>: Global MOD13Q1/MYD13Q1 MODIS vegetation indices
      are designed to provide consistent spatial and temporal comparisons of vegetation.
      conditions. Blue, red, and near-infrared reflectances, centered at 469-nanometers,
      645-nanometers, and 858-nanometers, respectively, are used to determine
      the MODIS daily vegetation indices.<br>
      The MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) complements NOAA's
      Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) NDVI products and provides
      continuity for time series historical applications. MODIS also includes a
      new Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) that minimizes canopy background variations
      and maintains sensitivity over dense vegetation conditions. The EVI also
      uses the blue band to remove residual atmosphere contamination caused by
      smoke and sub-pixel thin cloud clouds. The MODIS NDVI and EVI products are
      computed from atmospherically corrected bi-directional surface reflectances
      that have been masked for water, clouds, heavy aerosols, and cloud shadows.
      Global MOD13Q1/MYD13Q1 data are provided every 16 days at 250-meter spatial resolution
      as a gridded level-3 product in the Sinusoidal projection. Lacking a 250m
      blue band, the EVI algorithm uses the 500m blue band to correct for residual
      atmospheric effects, with negligible spatial artifacts
      (related <a href="https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/dataset_discovery/modis/modis_products_table/mod13q1_v006">MOD13Q1</a> and

      Global MOD13A1/MYD13A1 data are provided every 16 days at 500-meter spatial
      resolution as a gridded level-3 product in the Sinusoidal projection.
      Vegetation indices are used for global monitoring of vegetation conditions
      and are used in products displaying land cover and land cover changes.
      These data may be used as input for modeling global biogeochemical and
      hydrologic processes and global and regional climate. These data also may
      be used for characterizing land surface biophysical properties and processes,
      including primary production and land cover conversion

  <li><b>VI sixteen days 1 Km (Terra/Aqua)</b>:
      The MOD13A2 product provides a Vegetation Index (VI) value at a per pixel basis. There
      are 2 primary vegetation layers. The first is the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)
      which is referred to as the continuity index to the existing National Oceanic and Atmospheric
      Administration-Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (NOAA-AVHRR) derived NDVI. The second
      vegetation layer is the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), which has improved sensitivity over
      high biomass regions. The data are provided at 1000 m resolution as a gridded level-3 product
      in the Sinusoidal projection

  <li><b>VI sixteen days Global 0.05Deg CMG (Terra/Aqua)</b>:
      The MOD13C1 product provides a Vegetation Index (VI) value at a per pixel basis. There
      are 2 primary vegetation layers. The first is the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)
      which is referred to as the continuity index to the existing National Oceanic and Atmospheric
      Administration-Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (NOAA-AVHRR) derived NDVI. The second
      vegetation layer is the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), which has improved sensitivity over
      high biomass regions. The Climate Modeling Grid (CMG) consists 3600 rows and 7200 columns
      of 5600 m pixels and is provided as a global latitude/longitude grid

<h3>MODIS Snow</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Snow eight days 500 m (Terra/Aqua)</b>: The MOD10A2 and MYD10A2 products
      are composites of eight days of snow maps in the sinusoidal grid.
      An eight-day compositing period was chosen because that is the exact ground
      track repeat period of the Terra and Aqua platforms. Snow cover over eight
      days is mapped as maximum snow extent in one SDS and as a chronology of
      observations in the other SDS. Eight-day periods begin on the first day of
      the year and extend into the next year. The product can be produced with
      two to eight days of input. There may not always be eight days of input,
      because of various reasons, so the user should check the attributes to
      determine on what days observations were obtained. See the validation webpage
      for details on the validation and validation definitions
      (related <a href="https://nsidc.org/data/MOD10A2">MOD10A2</a> and
      <a href="https://nsidc.org/data/MYD10A2">MYD10A2</a> 
      product pages)</li>
  <li><b>Snow daily 500 m (Terra/Aqua)</b>: MOD10A1 and MYD10A1 are tiles of daily
      snow cover at 500 m spatial resolution. The daily observation selected from
      multiple observations in a MOD10A1 (or MYD10A1) cell is the observation
      acquired nearest nadir and having the greatest coverage of the grid cell.
      The daily MOD10A1 and MYD10A1 snow products are tiles of data gridded in the
      sinusoidal projection. Tiles are approximately 1200 x 1200 km in area. A
      single scientific data set (SDS) of snow cover and a single SDS of QA data
      along with local and global attributes comprise the data product file. The
      daily level 3 snow product is the result of selecting an observation from
      the multiple observations mapped to a cell of the MOD10_L2G (or MYD10_L2G)
      product. See the validation webpage for details on the validation and
      validation definitions
