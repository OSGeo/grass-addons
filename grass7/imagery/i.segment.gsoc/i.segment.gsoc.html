<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
Image segmentation is the process of grouping similar pixels into 
unique segments. Boundary and region based algorithms are described 
in the literature, currently a region growing and merging algorithm 
is implemented.  Each grouping (usually refered to as objects or 
segments) found during the segmentation process is given a unique ID 
and is a collection of contiguous pixels meeting some criteria.  
(Note the contrast with image classification, where continuity and 
spatial characteristics are not important, but rather only the 
spectral similarity.)  The results can be useful on their own, or 
used as a preprocessing step for image classification.  The 
segmentation preprocessing step can reduce noise and speed up the 
classification.

<H2>NOTES</h2>

<h3>Region Growing and Merging</h3>
This segmentation algorithm sequentially examines all current 
segments in the map.  The similarity between the current segment and 
each of its neighbors is calculated according to the given distance 
formula. Segments will be merged if they meet a number of criteria, 
including: 1.  The pair is mutually most similar to each other (the 
similarity distance will be smaller then all other neighbors), and 
2. The similarity must be lower then the input threshold.  All 
segments are checked once per pass.  The process is repeated until 
no merges are made during a complete pass.

<h3>Similarity and Threshold</h3>
The similarity between segments and unmerged pixels is used to 
determine which are merged.  The Euclidean version uses the 
radiometric distance between the two segments and also the shape 
characteristics. The Manhatten calculations currently only uses only 
the radiometric distance between the two segments, but eventually 
shape characteristics will be included as well.  NOTE: 
Closer/smaller distances mean a lower value for the similarity 
indicates a closer match, with a similarity score of zero for 
identical pixels.
<p>
During normal processing, merges are only allowed when the 
similarity between two segments is lower then the calculated 
threshold value. During the final pass, however, if a minimum 
segment size of 2 or larger is given with the <em>minsize</em> 
parameter, segments with a smaller pixel count will be merged with 
their most similar neighbor even if the similarity is greater then 
the threshold.
<p>
Unless the <em>-w</em> flag for weighted data is used, the threshold 
should be set by the user between 0 and 1.0. A threshold of 0 would 
allow only identical valued pixels to be merged, while a threshold 
of 1 would allow everything to be merged.
<p>
The threshold will be multiplied by the number of rasters included 
in the image group.  This will allow the same threshold to achieve 
similar segmentation results when the number of rasters in the image 
group varies.
<p>
The -t flag will estimate the threshold, it is calculated at 3% of 
the range of data in the imagery group.  Initial empirical tests 
indicate threshold values of 1% to 5% are reasonable places to start.

<h4>Calculation Formulas</h4>
Both Euclidean and Manhattan distances use the normal definition, 
considering each raster in the image group as a dimension.

Furthermore, the Euclidean calculation also takes into account the 
shape characteristics of the segments.  The normal distances are 
multiplied by the input radiometric weight.  Next an additional 
contribution is added: (1-radioweight) * {smoothness * smoothness 
weight + compactness * (1-smoothness weight)}, where compactness = 
the Perimeter Length / sqrt( Area ) and smoothness = Perimeter 
Length / the Bounding Box.  The perimeter length is estimated as the 
number of pixel sides the segment has.

<h3>Seeds</h3>
The seeds map can be used to provide either seed pixels (random or 
selected points from which to start the segmentation process) or 
seed segments (results of previous segmentations or 
classifications).  The different approaches are automatically 
detected by the program: any pixels that have identical seed values 
and are contiguous will be lumped into a single segment ID.
<p>
It is expected that the <em>minsize</em> will be set to 1 if a seed 
map is used, but the program will allow other values to be used.  If 
both options are used, the final iteration that ignores the 
threshold also will ignore the seed map and force merges for all 
pixels (not just segments that have grown/merged from the seeds).

<h3>Maximum number of starting segments</h3>
For the region growing algorithm without starting seeds, each pixel 
is sequentially numbered.  The current limit with CELL storage is 2 
billion starting segment ID's.  If the initial map has a larger 
number of non-null pixels, there are two workarounds:
<p>
1.  Use starting seed pixels.  (Maximum 2 billion pixels can be 
labeled with positive integers.)
<p>
2.  Use starting seed segments.  (By initial classification or other 
methods.)

<h3>Boundary Constraints</h3>
Boundary constraints limit the adjacency of pixels and segments.  
Each unique value present in the <em>bounds</em> raster are 
considered as a MASK.  Thus no segments in the final segmentated map 
will cross a boundary, even if their spectral data is very similar.

<h3>Minimum Segment Size</h3>
To reduce the salt and pepper affect, a <em>minsize</em> greater 
than 1 will add one additional pass to the processing.  During the 
final pass, the threshold is ignored for any segments smaller then 
the set size, thus forcing very small segments to merge with their 
most similar neighbor.

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>
This example uses the ortho photograph included in the NC Sample 
Dataset.  Set up an imagery group:<br>
<div class="code"><pre>
i.group group=ortho_group input=ortho_2001_t792_1m@PERMANENT
</pre></div>

<p>Because the segmentation process is computationally expensive, 
start with a small processing area to confirm if the segmentation 
results meet your requirements.  Some manual adjustment of the 
threshold may be required. <br>

<div class="code"><pre>
g.region raster=ortho_2001_t792_1m@PERMANENT n=220400 s=220200 e=639000 w=638800
</pre></div>

Try out a first threshold and check the results.<br>
<div class="code"><pre>
i.segment -w -l group=ortho_group output=ortho_segs threshold=4 \
          method=region_growing 
</pre></div>
<p></p>
From a visual inspection, it seems this results in oversegmentation.  
Increasing the threshold: <br>
<div class="code"><pre>
i.segment -w -l --overwrite group=ortho_group output=ortho_segs \
          threshold=10 method=region_growing
</pre></div>
<p></p>
This looks better.  There is some noise in the image, lets next force 
all segments smaller then 5 pixels to be merged into their most similar 
neighbor (even if they are less similar then required by our 
threshold):<br>
<div class="code"><pre>
i.segment -w -l --overwrite group=ortho_group output=ortho_segs \
          threshold=10 method=region_growing minsize=5
</pre></div>
<p></p>
Each of these segmentation steps took less then 1 minute on a decent 
machine.  Now that we are satisfied with the settings, we'll process 
the entire image:
<div class="code"><pre>
g.region raster=ortho_2001_t792_1m@PERMANENT<br>
i.segment -w -l --overwrite group=ortho_group output=ortho_segs \
          threshold=10 method=region_growing minsize=5 endt=5000
</pre></div>
<p>
Processing the entire ortho image (over 9 million pixels) took about 
a day.

<h2>TODO</h2>
<h3>Functionality</h3>
<ul>
<li>Further testing of the shape characteristics (smoothness, 
compactness), if it looks good it should be added to the Manhatten 
option.
<b>in progress</b></li>
<li>Malahanobis distance for the similarity calculation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Use of Segmentation Results</h3>
<ul>
<li>Improve the optional output from this module, or better yet, add a 
module for <em>i.segment.metrics</em>.</li>
<li>Providing updates to i.maxlik to ensure the segmentation output can 
be used as input for the existing classification functionality.</li>
<li>Integration/workflow for <em>r.fuzzy</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Speed</h3>
<ul>
<li>See create_isegs.c</li>
</ul>
<h3>Memory</h3>
<ul>
<li>User input for how much RAM can be used.</li>
<li>Check input map type(s), currently storing in DCELL sized SEG file, 
could reduce this dynamically depending on input map time. (Could only 
reduce to FCELL, since will be storing mean we can't use CELL. Might 
not be worth the added code complexity.)</li>
</ul>
<h2>BUGS</h2>
If the seeds map is used to give starting seed segments, the segments 
are renumbered starting from 1.  There is a chance a segment could be 
renumbered to a seed value that has not yet been processed.  If they 
happen to be adjacent, they would be merged.  (Possible fixes: a.  use 
a processing flag to make sure the pixels hasn't been previously used, 
or b. use negative segment ID's as a placeholder and negate all values 
after the seed map has been processed.)
