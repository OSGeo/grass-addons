<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>i.eb.z0m0</em> calculates the momentum roughness length (z0m) and optionally the surface roughness for heat transport (z0h) as per SEBAL requirements from bastiaanssen (1995).
This version is calculating from a NDVI with an deterministic equation, as seen in Bastiaanssen (1995).
This is a typical input to sensible heat flux computations of any energy balance modeling.
<h2>NOTES</h2>

The NDVI map input and the ndvi_max operation set, is only to get a linear relationship from NDVI to vegetation height. The latter being related to z0m by a factor 7. 

If you happen to have a vegetation height (hv) map, then z0m=hv/7 and z0h=0.1*z0m. There, fixed.
