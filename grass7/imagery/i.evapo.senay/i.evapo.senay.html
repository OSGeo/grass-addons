<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>i.evapo.senay</em> Calculates the diurnal actual 
evapotranspiration after Senay (2007). This is converting all Net 
radiation from the diurnal period into ET, then uses Senay equation 
for evaporative fraction.
<p>
It takes input maps of Albedo, surface skin temperature, latitude, 
day of year, single-way transmissivity and takes input value of the 
density of fresh water. 
<p>
DEM is used for calculating min and max temperature for Senay equation.
<p>
The "-s" flag permits output map of evaporative fraction from Senay.

<h2>NOTES</h2>
If you are trying to map irrigated crops, and you know there is at least
one crop pixel that is evapotranspiring at maximum (ETa=ETpot), then read this.
<p>
<em>i.evapo.senay</em> is highly dependent on the wet pixel being 
the lowest temperature in the crop pixels to work for non water 
stressed crops, force it that way, even if it breaks non crop areas. 
I suggest you reduce your region to the irrigation system 
boundaries, checking that it includes a bit of dry area for the 
hot/dry pixel.
<p>
Since it is a direct relationship to LST, evaporative fraction can 
be very sensitive to the kind of pixel sample you feed it with.
