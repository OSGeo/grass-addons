<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em><b>r.randomforest</b></em> performs Random forests classification and regression on a GRASS imagery group. Random forests (Breiman, 2001) represents an ensemble classification tree method which constructs a forest of uncorrelated decision trees based on a random subset of predictor variables, which occurs independently at every node split in each tree. Each tree produces a classification and the forest chooses the classification result which has the most votes over all of the trees. The probability of membership (<i>class_probabilities</i> flag) is based on the proportion of votes for each class.

<br><br>Random forests offers a number of advantages over traditional statistical classifiers because it is non-parametric and can deal with non-linear relationships. Furthermore, continuous and categorical data can be used, and no rescaling is required. Another practical advantage of random forests is that it involves few user-specified parameter choices, principally consisting of the number of trees in the forest (<i>ntrees</i>), and the number of variables that are allowed to be chosen from at each node split (<i>mfeatures</i>), which controls the degree of correlation between the trees. Furthermore, there is no accuracy penalty in having a large number of trees apart from increased computational time. However, the performance of RF models typically level off at a certain number of trees, at which point there is no further benefit in terms of error reduction in using a larger forest.

<br><br>An additional feature of random forests is that it includes built-in accuracy assessment and variable selection. Random forests uses the concept of bagging, where a randomly selected 66% subset of the training data are held-out 'out-of-bag' (OOB) in the construction of each tree, and then OOB data are used to evaluate the prediction accuracy. The OOB error has been shown to provide a reliable estimate of classification error. Note that this is applied on a pixel-basis in the module, and the OOB error assumes that the training data are not spatially correlated. If you training data represent individual pixels that are separated by x distance, then this assumption may hold true. However, if your training data represent rasterized polygons, then this assumption will likely be false, and you should use an independent set of polygons to test the accuracy of the classification using <i>i.kappa</i>.

The random forests scikit-learn implementation also includes a measure of variable importance based on the Gini impurity criterion, which measures how each variable contributes to the homogeneity of the nodes, with important variables causing a larger decrease in the Gini coefficient in successive node splits. This variable importance allows the contributions of the individual predictors to be determined. The feature importance scores are output to the command display.

<br><br>Random forests classification like most machine learning methods does not perform well in the case of a large class imbalance. In this case, the classifier will seek to reduce the overall model error, but this will occur by predicting the majority class with a very high accuracy, but at the expense of the minority class, i.e. high sensitivity but low specificity. If you have a highly imbalanced dataset, the 'balanced' flag can be set. The scikit-learn implementation balanced mode then automatically adjust weights inversely proportional to class frequencies.

<br><br>Random forest can also be run in regression mode by setting the <i>mode</i> to the regression option. You also can increase the generalization ability of the classifier by increasing minsplit, which represents the minimum number of samples required in order to split a node. The balanced and class_probabilities options are ignored for regression.

<br><br>The module also offers the potential to save and load a random forests model. The model is saved as a list of filenames for each numpy array. This list can involve a large number of files, so it makes sense to save each model in a separate directory.

<br><br> Saving a model represents a useful feature because it allows a model to be built on one imagery group (ie. set of predictor variables), and then the prediction can be performed on other imagery groups. This approach is commonly employed in species prediction modelling, or landslide susceptibility modelling, where a classification or regression model is built with one set of predictors (e.g. which include present-day climatic variables) and then predictions can be performed on other imagery groups containing forecasted climatic variables. The names of the GRASS rasters in the imagery groups do not matter because scikit learn saves the model as a series of numpy arrays. However, the new imagery group must contain the same number of rasters, and they should be in the same order as in the imagery group upon which the model was built. As an example, the new imagery group may have a raster named 'mean_precipitation_2050' which substitutes the 'mean_precipitation_2016' in the imagery group that was used to build the model. 

<h2>NOTES</h2>

<em><b>r.randomforest</b></em> uses the scikit-learn machine learning python package, and the pandas package. These python packages need to be installed within your GRASS python environment for <em><b>r.randomforest</b></em> to work. For linux users, both of these packages should be available through the linux package manager in most distributions. For windows users, the easiest way of installing the packages is by using the precompiled binaries from <a href="http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/">Christoph Gohlke</a> and by using the <a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/download/software/ms-windows/">Osgeo4W</a> installation method of GRASS, where the python setuptools can also be installed. You can then use 'easy_install pip' to install the pip package manager. Then, you can download the NumPy-1.10+MKL, scikit-learn and pandas .whl files and install them using 'pip install packagename.whl'.

<em><b>r.randomforest</b></em> is designed to keep system memory requirements relatively low. For this purpose, the rasters are read from the disk row-by-row, using the RasterRow method in PyGRASS. This however does not represent an efficient volume of data to pass to the classifier, which is multithreaded by default, and results in a stop-start behaviour. Therefore, groups of rows specified by the <i>lines</i> parameter are passed to the classifier, and the reclassified image is reconstructed and written row-by-row back to the disk. <i>Lines=100</i> should be reasonable for most systems with 4-8 GB of ram. However, if you have a workstation with much larger resources, then <i>lines</i> could be set to a much larger size (including to a value that is equal or greater than the number of rows in the current region setting) in which case the entire image will be loaded into memory to classification.

<br><br> The bootstrapping process involved within random forests also causes a small amount of variation in the classification results, out-of-bag error, and feature importances. To enable reproducible results, a seed is supplied to the classifier. This can be changed using the <i>randst</i> parameter.
