    Implementation of an Ant like Agent for an Anthill, a kind of World
    that works after ACO rules (see Anthill).

    Ants are wandering around by chance until they find some goal cell,
    then they will mark their way back home with pheromone. Following ants
    choose the marked cells on the playground more likely then unmarked
    spots.

    There are several optimizations / idealizations to choose from,
    as ACO comes from graph theory and raster layers map quite large
    graphs (e.g. loops are a major source of sorrow).
