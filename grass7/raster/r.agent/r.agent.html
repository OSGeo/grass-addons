<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.agent</em> consists of a library <em>libagent</em> and some submodules
which use this it. The submodules are described in their resp. directories.
The library provides the basic functionality to introduce agent based modeling
on raster maps and fully integrates with GRASS thanks to the new python API!
<p>
For a maximum of transparency and the hope that it might serve as a
framework to build more submodules on it, it is written in python and in
an object oriented manner.
<p>
Let's think of the maps and layers as playgrounds where little worlds
with agents may evolve.
<p>
Please note the <em>tests</em> subfolder. It contains unit tests that
might be called after each change on the library to verify that nothing
was broken during the development.
