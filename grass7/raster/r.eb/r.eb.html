<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>The environmental bias (EB) takes the medium conditions in an 
area <em>N</em> and computes how much conditions in a subset of <em>N
</em> (<em>S</em>) deviate from these medium conditions. This can for 
example be used to see how well conditions in the protected areas of 
a country represent conditions in the whole country.

<p>The messure is based on the Multivariate Environmental Similarity 
(<em>MES</em>) surface, which was proposed by Elith et al (2010). To compute 
the MES First the similarity of a point <em>P</em> to the conditions 
in <em>N</em> with respect to variable <em>V</em> is computed. The 
similarity is expressed as the deviation from the median of <em>V</em> 
in <em>P</em> to those in <em>N</em>. This is done for all variables of 
interest (V<sub>1</sub>, V<sub>2</sub>, ...V<sub>j</sub>).

<p>In the original equation proposed by Elith et al (2010) the final 
<em>MES</em> of <em>P</em> is computed as the minimum of the 
similarity values (<em>IES<sub>minimum</sub></em>) of the individual 
variables (<em>V<sub>j</sub></em>) in <em>P</em>. In <em>r.eb</em> 
there is the option to use the mean (<em>IES<sub>mean</sub></em>) or 
median (<em>IES<sub>median</sub></em>) of the <em>IES</em> instead. 
For the EB these may be a better choice as they take into account 
the similarity along all environmnetal axes and not only the one 
that deviates most. 

<p>The <em>EB</em> is computed as the absolute difference of the median 
of the <em>MES</em> in the whole target area (MES<sub>n</sub>) and the 
median of the <em>MES</em> in the subset (<em>MES<sub>s</sub></em>), 
divided by the median absolute deviation 
(<em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_absolute_deviation">MAD</a></em>
) of the <em>MES</em> in <em>N</em>. It is also possible to compute 
the <em>EB</em> based on the individual variables in which case the 
<em>IES</em> instead of the <em>MES</em> is used.
