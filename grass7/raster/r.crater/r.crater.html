<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.crater</em> This program estimates the size of a gravity dominated impact crater or the projectile that made it.
<p>
<em>Forward mode</em> This mode needs to know the projectile details<br>
L: projectile diameter (m)<br>
r_proj: projectile density (kg/m^3)<br>
Vi: Projectile velocity (km/s)<br>
theta: projectile impact angle (degrees) for Gault scaling law (flag2)<br>
Solid_rock or not (1 or 0) for Gault  scaling law (flag2)<br>
<p>
<em>Backward mode</em>This mode needs to know the crater details<br>


<h2>NOTES</h2>
Gault scaling law saturates at craters 1000 Diameter Apparent Transient, and was essentially designed for regolith (Moon surface).

<p>
Below is explanation from the Meloch Fortran code (not included because of copyright)
<p>
Three different estimates are presented, but the pi-scaling method is currently considered the best!
<p>
Impact conditions:
argv[1]: enter the impact velocity in km/sec
argv[2]: enter the impact angle in degrees
<p>
Target descriptors:
argv[3]: enter the target density in kg/m^3
argv[4]: enter the acceleration of gravity in m/sec^2
<p>
argv[5]: enter the target type, (1-3):
type 1 = liquid water
type 2 = loose sand
type 3 = competent rock or saturated soil
argv[6]: enter the projectile density in kg/m^3
<p>	
argv[7]: enter the type of computation desired (1 or 2):
	Mode 1, crater size
	Mode 2, projectile size
<p>
Mode 1: Estimate crater diameter from projectile size
Mode 1 case: Projectile descriptors:
argv[8]: enter the projectile diameter in m
<p>
Mode 2: Estimate crater size from crater diameter*/
Mode 2 case: Crater descriptor:
argv[8]: enter the transient crater diameter in m (if the final, not the transient crater diameter is known, enter zero (0.0) here)
argv[9]: [optional] enter the final crater diameter in m
