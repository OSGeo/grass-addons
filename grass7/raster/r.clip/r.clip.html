<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

The module extracts portion of the <b>input</b> raster map according to
the current computational region. The areas outside of the computational
region are clipped and only the inner part is kept.
The <b>input</b> raster map is left intact and a new (clipped)
<b>output</b> raster map is created in the process.

<p>
By default the cell size and the cell alignment of the original raster
is preserved. In other words, the output map inherits its resolution and
cell positions (grid) from the input raster rather than the
computational region.

<p>
If resampling into the cells size and cell alignment of the
current computational is desired, the module can perform a nearest
neighbor resampling when the <b>-r</b> flag is used.
If more advanced resampling is required, the user is advised to to use
one of the dedicated resampling modules.

<p>
If mask (<em><a href="r.mask.html">r.mask</a></em>) is active, it is
respected and the output raster map will contain NULL (no data) values
according to the mask.
Otherwise, values in the <b>input</b> raster map are simply transfered
to the <b>output</b> raster map.

<p>
The color table of the output raster map is set according to the
input raster map, so that the colors in both raster maps will match.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

<ul>

<li>
In GRASS GIS, clipping of rasters is usually not needed because
modules respect the current computational region and clipping
(with possible resampling) is done automatically.

<li>
If the user needs to clip raster map according to another raster map or
according to a vector map,
the <em><a href="g.region.html">g.region</a></em> should be used first
before running the <em>r.clip</em> module.

<li>
The extent of the resulting map might be slightly different based on how
the cells of the input raster align with the cells of the computational
region. The mechanism for aligning in the background is the one used in
<em><a href="g.region.html">g.region</a></em>. If exact match is
desired, user is advised to resolve the cell alignment ahead using
<em><a href="g.region.html">g.region</a></em> and then use
<em>r.clip</em> with the <b>-r</b> flag.

</ul>

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

The following examples are using the full North Carolina sample
location.

<h3>Clip according to a raster map</h3>

First we set the computational region to match the raster map called
<em>elev_lid792_1m</em> which we want to use for clipping:

<div class="code"><pre>
g.region raster=elev_lid792_1m
</pre></div>

Now, the following will clip raster map called <em>elevation</em>
according to the extent of <em>elev_lid792_1m</em> raster map creating
a new raster map called <em>elevation_clipped</em>:

<div class="code"><pre>
r.clip input=elevation output=elevation_clipped
</pre></div>

<h3>Clip and then compare the resolutions</h3>

The following example clips (crops) raster map called <em>elevation</em>
according to the current region resulting in a new raster map called
<em>clipped_elevation</em>.
The computational region will be set match raster map called
<em>elev_lid792_1m</em> since this the extent we want to work with
in this example.

<p>
First we set the computational region to match a raster map called
<em>elev_lid792_1m</em>:

<div class="code"><pre>
g.region raster=elev_lid792_1m
</pre></div>

This is the computational region we want to have.
Now we check the new region using:

<div class="code"><pre>
g.region -g
</pre></div>

In the output, we can see extent, resolution in both directions,
and number of rows and columns:

<pre>
...
n=220750
s=220000
w=638300
e=639000
nsres=1
ewres=1
rows=750
cols=700
cells=525000
...
</pre>

Now we perform the clipping:

<div class="code"><pre>
r.clip input=elevation output=clipped_elevation
</pre></div>

Finally, we check the size of the new raster map using:

<div class="code"><pre>
r.info map=clipped_elevation -g
</pre></div>

In the output, we can see that the extent is the same
(exactly the same in this case) as the computational region
while the resolution and number of cells is different:

<pre>
...
north=220750
south=220000
east=639000
west=638300
nsres=10
ewres=10
rows=75
cols=70
cells=5250
...
</pre>

The reason for this is that the <em>elevation</em> map was not
resampled, instead the cell values and positions were preserved.
The number of cells depends on the resolution which was derived from
the original <em>elevation</em> map. To see it, we can use the
following:

<div class="code"><pre>
r.info map=elevation -g
</pre></div>

The output shows the resolution used for the new
<em>clipped_elevation</em> as well as much higher number of cells and
larger extent of the original map:

<pre>
...
north=228500
south=215000
east=645000
west=630000
nsres=10
ewres=10
rows=1350
cols=1500
cells=2025000
...
</pre>
