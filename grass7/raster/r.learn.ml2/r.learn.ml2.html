<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p><em>r.learn.ml2</em> represents a front-end to the scikit learn python package. The module
	enables scikit-learn classification and regression models to be applied to GRASS GIS rasters
	that are stored as part of an imagery group <em>group</em> or specified as individual maps in
	the optional <em>raster</em> parameter.</p>

<p>The training component of the machine learning workflow is performed using the 
	<em>r.learn.train</em> module. This module uses training data consisting of labelled pixels
	in a GRASS GIS raster map, or a GRASS GIS vector containing points, and develops a machine
	learning model on the rasters within a GRASS imagery group. This model needs to be saved to a
	file and can be automatically compressed if the .gz file extension is used.</p>

<p>After a model is training, the <em>i.learn.predict</em> module needs to be called, which will
	retrieve the saved and pre-fitted model and apply it to a GRASS GIS imagery group.</p>

<h2>NOTES</h2>

<p><em>r.learn.ml2</em> uses the "scikit-learn" machine learning python package (version &ge; 0.20)
	along with the "pandas" package. These packages need to be installed within your GRASS GIS
	Python environment. For Linux users, these packages should be available through the linux
	package manager. For MS-Windows users using a 64 bit GRASS, the easiest way of installing the
	packages is by using the precompiled binaries from <a
		href="http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/">Christoph Gohlke</a> and by using the <a
		href="https://grass.osgeo.org/download/software/ms-windows/">OSGeo4W</a> installation method 
	of GRASS, where the python setuptools can also be installed. You can then use 'easy_install pip'
	to install the pip package manager. Then, you can download the NumPy+MKL and scikit-learn .whl
	files.</p>

<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>

<p>Here we are going to use the GRASS GIS sample North Carolina data set as a basis to perform a
	landsat classification. We are going to classify a Landsat 7 scene from 2000, using training
	information from an older (1996) land cover dataset.</p>

<p>Landsat 7 (2000) bands 7,4,2 color composite example:</p>
<center>
	<img src="lsat7_2000_b742.png" alt="Landsat 7 (2000) bands 7,4,2 color composite example">
</center>

<p>Note that this example must be run in the "landsat" mapset of the North Carolina sample data set
	location.</p>

<p>First, we are going to generate some training pixels from an older (1996) land cover
	classification:</p>

<div class="code">
	<pre>
g.region raster=landclass96 -p
r.random input=landclass96 npoints=1000 raster=training_pixels
</pre>
</div>

<p>Then we can use these training pixels to perform a classification on the more recently obtained
	landsat 7 image:</p>
	
<div class="code">
	<pre>
# train a random forest classification model using r.learn.train 
r.learn.train group=lsat7_2000 training_map=training_pixels \
	model_name=RandomForestClassifier n_estimators=500 save_model=rf_model.gz

# perform prediction using r.learn.predict
r.learn.predict group=lsat7_2000 load_model=rf_model.gz output=rf_classification

# check raster categories - they are automatically applied to the classification output
r.category rf_classification

# copy color scheme from landclass training map to result
r.colors rf_classification raster=training_pixels
</pre>
</div>

<p>Random forest classification result:</p>
