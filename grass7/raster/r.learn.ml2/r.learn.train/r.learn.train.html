<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p><em>r.learn.train</em> performs training data extraction, supervised machine learning and 
	cross-validation using the python package <em>scikit learn</em>. The choice of machine
	learning algorithm is set using the <em>model_name</em> parameter. For more details relating
	to the classifiers, refer to the <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/"> scikit learn documentation</a>.
	The training data can be provided either by a GRASS raster map containing labelled pixels using
	the <em>training_map</em> parameter, or a GRASS vector dataset containing point geometries
	using the <em>training_points</em> parameter. If a vector map is used then the <em>field</em>
	parameter also needs to indicate which column in the vector attribute table contains the
	labels/values for training.</p>
	
	<p>For regression models the <em>field </em>parameter must contain only numeric values. For
		classification models the field can contain integer-encoded labels, or it can represent
		text categories that will automatically be encoded as integer values (in alphabetical
		order). These text labels will also be applied as categories to the classification output
		when using <b>r.learn.predict</b>. The vector map should also not contain multiple
		geometries per attribute.</p>

<h3>Hyperparameters</h3>

<p>The estimator settings tab provides access to the most pertinent parameters that affect the
	previously described algorithms. The scikit-learn estimator defaults are generally supplied,
	and these parameters can be tuned using a grid-search by inputting multiple comma-separated
	parameters. The grid search is performed using a 2-fold cross validation. This tuning can also
	be accomplished simultaneously with nested cross-validation by settings the <em>cv</em> option
	to &gt 1.</p>

<h3>Preprocessing</h3>

<p>Although tree-based classifiers are insensitive to the scaling of the input data, other
	classifiers such as linear models may not perform optimally if some predictors have variances
	that are orders of magnitude larger than others. The <em>-s</em> flag adds a standardization
	preprocessing step to the classification and prediction to reduce this effect. Additionally,
	most of the classifiers do not perform well if there is a large class imbalance in the training
	data. Using the <em>-b</em> flag balances the training data by weighting of the minority classes
	relative to the majority class. This does not apply to the Naive Bayes or
	LinearDiscriminantAnalysis classifiers.</p>

<p>Scikit learn does not specifically recognize raster predictors that represent non-ordinal,
	categorical values, for example if using a landcover map as a predictor. Predictive
	performances may be improved if the categories in these maps are one-hot encoded before 
	training. The parameter <em>categorical_maps</em> can be used to select rasters that in
	contained within the imagery group to apply one-hot encoding before training.</p>

<h3>Feature Importances</h3>

<p>In addition to model fitting and prediction, feature importances can be generated using the
	<b>-f</b> flag. The feature importances method uses a permutation-based method can be applied
	to all the estimators. The feature importances represent the average decrease in performance of
	each variable when permuted. For binary classifications, the AUC is used as the metric.
	Multiclass classifications use accuracy, and regressions use R2.</p>

<h3>Cross-Validation</h3>

<p>Cross validation can be performed by setting the <em>cv</em> parameters to &gt 1.
	Cross-validation is performed using stratified k-folds for classification and k-folds for
	regression. Several global and per-class accuracy measures are produced depending on whether
	the response variable is binary or multiclass, or the classifier is for regression or
	classification. Cross-validation can also be performed in groups by supplying a raster
	containing the group_ids of the partitions using the <em>group_raster</em> option. In this
	case, training samples with the same group id as set by the group_raster will never be split
	between training and test partitions during cross-validation. This can reduce problems with
	overly optimistic cross-validation scores if the training data are strongly spatially
	correlated, i.e. the training data represent rasterized polygons.</p>

<h2>NOTES</h2>

<p>Many of the estimators involve a random process which can causes a small amount of variation in
	the classification/regression results and and feature importances. To enable reproducible
	results, a seed is supplied to the estimator. This can be changed using the <em>randst</em>
	parameter.</p>

<p>For convenience when repeatedly training models on the same data, the training data can be saved
	to a csv file using the <em>save_training</em> option. This data can then imported into
	subsequent classification runs, saving time by avoiding the need to repeatedly query the
	predictors.</p>

<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>

<p>Here we are going to use the GRASS GIS sample North Carolina data set as a basis to perform a
	landsat classification. We are going to classify a Landsat 7 scene from 2000, using training
	information from an older (1996) land cover dataset.</p>

<p>Landsat 7 (2000) bands 7,4,2 color composite example:</p>
<center>
	<img src="lsat7_2000_b742.png" alt="Landsat 7 (2000) bands 7,4,2 color composite example">
</center>

<p>Note that this example must be run in the "landsat" mapset of the North Carolina sample data set
	location.</p>

<p>First, we are going to generate some training pixels from an older (1996) land cover
	classification:</p>

<div class="code">
	<pre>
g.region raster=landclass96 -p
r.random input=landclass96 npoints=1000 raster=training_pixels
</pre>
</div>

<p>Then we can use these training pixels to perform a classification on the more recently obtained
	landsat 7 image:</p>

<div class="code">
	<pre>
# train a random forest classification model using r.learn.train 
r.learn.train group=lsat7_2000 training_map=training_pixels \
	model_name=RandomForestClassifier n_estimators=500 save_model=rf_model.gz

# perform prediction using r.learn.predict
r.learn.predict group=lsat7_2000 load_model=rf_model.gz output=rf_classification

# check raster categories - they are automatically applied to the classification output
r.category rf_classification

# copy color scheme from landclass training map to result
r.colors rf_classification raster=training_pixels
</pre>
</div>

<p>Random forest classification result:</p>
