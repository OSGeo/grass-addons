<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

Multi-criteria or suitability analyses are useful methods to map the 
relative suitability. For example, it can be used to map the relative 
habitat suitability of a species, based on multiple criteria. A typical 
outcome of such analyses is a raster layer with suitability scores 
between 0 (not suitable) to 1 (very suitable). 

<p>Often, the next step is to use this suitability map to identify 
suitable area/region, e.g., to demarcate potential areas for nature 
conservation. With this addon you can identify regions of contiguous 
cells that all have a suitability score above a certain threshold and a 
minimum size. There are a number of additional options explored below.

<h3>Option 1 - basic use</h3>

The user defines a threshold suitability score. All raster cells with a 
suitability score equal or above the threshold are reclassified as 
suitable. All other raster cells are reclassified to NODATA. Next, all 
contiguous raster cells (i.e., all neighboring rastercells) are 
clumped. Clumps below an user-defined size (minimum area for fragments) 
are subsequently removed. See <a 
href="https://grass.osgeo.org/grass78/manuals/r.reclass.area.html" 
target="_blank">r.reclass.area</a> for more details.

contiguous raster cells with a suitability score of 0.7 or 
more.</i></p>

<p>You would use this to find suitable areas for a species that cannot 
or is not likely to venture into areas where conditions are not 
optimal. 

<h3>Option 2 - focal area</h3>

To consider the requirements (of e.g., a species) at a landscape scale, 
the suitability of the habitat of the surrounding cells can be taken 
into account as well. This is done by first computing a raster where 
the value for each output cell is a function (maximum, median, 1st 
quartile or 3rd quartile) of the values of all the input cells in a 
user-defined neighborhood around that location. For example, the 5x5 
neighborhood below. Using the maximum as statistic, the central cell 
would be assigned a value of 5. Using this median, it would be assigned 
the value 2. See <a 
href="https://grass.osgeo.org/grass78/manuals/r.neighbors.html" 
target="_blank">r.neighbors</a> for more details.

<div class="code"><pre>
1 1 2 2 1
4 4 1 3 1
1 3 2 1 4
5 2 1 3 2
1 2 3 2 1
</pre></div>

<p>Next, the resulting output map is used instead of the original 
suitability map to identify the raster cells with a score equal to or 
above the user-defined threshold value. So, raster cells are selected 
if they have a suitability score equal or above the threshold value, or 
if at least one raster cell (maximum), half of the raster cells 
(median), 25% of the raster cells (1st quartile), or 75% of the raster 
cells (3rd quartile) in the neighborhood have a suitability score equal 
or above the given threshold.  

<p>Like above, the selected raster cells are clumped into contiguous 
regions, and regions that are smaller than an user-defined size are 
removed. This option would be a good choice if the target species has 
no problem to briefly stay in non-suitable habitat, e.g., to cross it 
on their way to more suitable habitat. As the example below shows, it 
results in larger regions than in the previous option.

<p><img src="option02.png"><i>Figure 2: Like figur 1, but based on the 
median suitability scores of the neighboring cells within a radius of 
300 meter (3x3 moving window).</i></p>

<h3>Option 3 - barriers</h3>

The user has the option to define an absolute minimum suitability 
score. Raster cells with a suitability below this score are always 
considered unsuitable, irrespective of the suitability scores of the 
surrounding raster cells. This option only affects the results of 
option 2.

<p>This option can be used to identify barriers or areas where a 
species cannot cross. For example, a road can break up larger regions 
of otherwise suitable habitats into smaller fragments. For species that 
cannot cross roads, this effectively results in smaller isolated 
populations rather than one large (meta-)population. It can even result 
in a net loss of habitat if one or more of the fragments are too small 
to maintain a population (the user can set a minimum area size to 
account for this). 

<p><img src="option03.png"><i>Figure 3: Like figure 2, but considering 
raster cells with suitability 0 (mostly roads) as absolute barriers. 
Diagonally connected raster cells are not considered to form a 
contiguous region.</i></p>

<p>Note that for line elements like roads, results may differ if the 
option to include the diagonal neighbors when defining clumps is 
selected. For example, in figure 4, diagonally connected cells are 
considered as neighbors. So the areas above and below the road are 
connected at among others the marked locations. 

<p><img src="option04.png"><i>Figure 4: Like figure 3, but this time, 
diagonally connected raster cells are considered to form a contiguous 
region.</i></p>

<h3>Option 4 - compact areas</h3>

The user can opt to include patches of unsuitable areas that fall 
within suitable regions into the final selection of suitable regions. 
Only gaps smaller than an user-defined maximum size will be included. 

<p>This option can be used to end up with more compact areas. This may 
be desirable for visualisation purposes, or it may in fact be 
acceptable to include such areas in the final selection of a region. 

<p><img src="option05.png"><i>Figure 5: Like figure 3 (left), but here 
gaps (areas within a suitable region) of 500 hectares or less were 
included in the final selection (middle). The right map shows the 
suitable areas within the selected regions (green) and the filled gaps 
(yellow).</i></p>

<p>Selecting this option will generate a second map which shows the 
these 'filled patches'. This makes it easier to  e.g., inspect the 
feasibility or desirability to actually include these areas in a 
protected areas. It furthermore makes it easier to calculate the area 
of the total area of the region and the area within the region with 
suitable habitat.

<h3>Other options</h3>

The use can opt to save two intermediate layers: the layer showing all 
raster cells with a suitability > threshold (flag k; file name as 
suffix <i>_allsuitableareas</i>), and the layer with the suitability 
based on focal statistics (flag f; file name as suffix 
<i>_focalsuitability</i>). 

<p>There is furthermore the option to create a layer with the average 
suitability per clump (flag z), and a layer with the surface area (in 
hectares) of the clumped regions (flag a).


<h2>NOTE</h2>

This addon is based on the <i>r.reclas.area</i> function. Like in that 
function, the user can opt to consider diagonally connected raster 
cells to be part of a contiguous region. Using this option will in most 
cases result in less compact regions. It may furthermore result in 
regions that would otherwise be considered as separate regions to be 
considered one large region.

<p>The option to calculate the area of clumped regions should be used 
with projected layers only because the assumption is that all cells 
have the same size.
