    The following 'mobility' function, is identical to the one used in
    `compute_attractiveness()`, excluding, however, the 'score' term:

        if(L10<>0,(1+$D$3)/($D$3+exp(-$E$3*L10))*52,0)

    Source: Excel file provided by the MAES Team, Land Resources, D3

    ------------------------------------------------------------------
    if L<>0; then
      # (1 + D) / (D + exp(-E * L)) * 52)

      #  D: Kappa
      # -E: Alpha -- Note the '-' sign in front of E
      #  L: Population (within boundary, within distance buffer)
    ------------------------------------------------------------------

    Parameters
    ----------

    distance :
        Map of distance categories

    constant :
        Constant for the mobility function

    coefficients :
        A dictionary with a set for coefficients for each distance category, as
        (the example) presented in the following table:

        |----------+---------+---------|
        | Distance | Kappa   | Alpha   |
        |----------+---------+---------|
        | 0 to 1   | 0.02350 | 0.00102 |
        |----------+---------+---------|
        | 1 to 2   | 0.02651 | 0.00109 |
        |----------+---------+---------|
        | 2 to 3   | 0.05120 | 0.00098 |
        |----------+---------+---------|
        | 3 to 4   | 0.10700 | 0.00067 |
        |----------+---------+---------|
        | >4       | 0.06930 | 0.00057 |
        |----------+---------+---------|

        Note, the last distance category is not considered in deriving the
        final "map of visits".

        Note, the Alpha coefficient, is signed with a '-' in the mobility
        function.

    population :
        A map with the distribution of the demand per distance category and
        predefined geometric boundaries (see `r.stats.zonal` deriving the
        'demand' map ).

    score :
        A score value for the mobility function

    suitability :
        [ NOTE: this argument is yet unused!  It is meant to be used only after
        successful integration of land suitability scores in
        build_distance_function(). ]
        If 'suitability' is given, it is used as a multiplication
        factor to the base equation.

    real_numbers :
        If real_numbers is False (which is the default), the mapcalc expression
        used to build the mobility function, will derive integer values.

    Returns
    -------

    mobility_expression :
        A valid mapcalc expression to compute the flow based on the
        predefined function `build_distance_function`.

    Examples
    --------
