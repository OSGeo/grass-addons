<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.series.diversity</em> computes one or more diversity indices 
based on 2 or more input layers. Each layer should represents a 
species (or other categories being used), and its raster values the 
category count/value. The name of the output layers will consist of 
the base name provided by the user. Currently implemented are the 
Renyi entropy index and a number of specialized cases of the Renyi 
enthropy, viz.the species richness, the Shannon index, the Shannon 
based effective number of species (ENS), the Simpson index (inverse 
and gini variants), pielou's eveness (Legendre & Legendre, 1998). 

<h4>The Renyi enthropy</h4>

This index quantify the diversity, uncertainty, or randomness of a 
system. The user can define the order of diversity by setting the 
order (<i>alpha</i>) value. The order of a diversity indicates its 
sensitivity to common and rare species. The diversity of order zero 
( <i>alpha = 0</i>)  is completely insensitive to species 
frequencies and is better known as species richness. Increasing the 
order diminishes the relative weights of rare species in the 
resulting index (Jost 2006, Legendre & Legendre 1998). The name of 
the output layer is composed of the basename + renyi + alpha.

<h4>Richness</h4>

The species richness is simply the count of the number of layers. 
It is a special case of the Reny enthropy: <i>S = exp(R0)</i>, 
whereby <i>S</i> is the species richness <i>R0</i> the renyi index 
for <i>alpha=0</i>. The name of the output layer is composed of the 
basename + richness.

<h4>Shannon index</h4>

The Shannon (also called the Shannon-Weaver or Shannon-Wiener) 
index is defined as <i>H' = -sum(p_i x log(p_i))</i>, where <i>p_i
</i> is the proportional abundance of species <i>i</i>. The function 
uses the natural logarithm (one can also use other bases for the 
log, but that is currently not implemented, and doesn't make a real 
difference). Note the Shannon index is a special case of the Renyi 
enthropy for <i>alpha --> 1</i>. The name of the output layer is 
composed of the basename + shannon.

<h4>Effective number of species (ENS)</h4>

This option gives the Shannon index, converted to into equivalent or 
effective numbers of species (also known as Hill numbers) (Lou Jost, 
2006; Chase and Knight, 2013). The Shannon index, and other indice, 
can be converted so they represent the number of equally abundant 
species necessary to produce the observed value of diversity (an 
analogue the concept of effective population size in genetics). An 
advantage of the ENS is a more intuitive behavious, e.g., if two 
communities with equally abundant but totally distinct species are 
combined, the ENS of the combined community is twice that of the 
original communities. See for an explanation and examples this
<a href="http://www.loujost.com/Statistics%20and%20Physics/Diversity%20and%20Similarity/EffectiveNumberOfSpecies.htm">blog post</a>
or <a href="http://jonlefcheck.net/2012/10/23/diversity-as-effective-numbers">this one</a>.
The name of the output layer is composed of the 
basename + ens.

<h4>Pielou's eveness (equitability) index</h4>

Species evenness refers to how close in numbers each species in 
an environment are. The evenness of a community can be represented 
by Pielou's evenness index, which is defined as <i>H' / Hmax</i>. H' 
is the Shannon diversity index and Hmax the maximum value of H', 
equal to log(species richness). Note that a weakness of this index 
is its dependence on species counts, and more specifically that it 
is a ratio of a relatively stable index, H', and one that is 
strongly dependent on sample size, S. The name of the output layer 
is composed of the basename + pielou.

<h4>Simpson's index of diversity</h4>

The Simpson's index is defined as <i>D = sum p_i^2</i>. This is 
equivalent to <i>-1 * 1 / exp(R2)</i>, with <i>R2</i> the renyi index 
for <i>alpha=2</i>. With this index, 0 represents infinite diversity 
and 1, no diversity. As this is counterintuitive behavior for a 
diversity index, we use <i>1 - D</i> (Gini, 1912; Simpson, 1949). This 
is also called the probability of interspecific encounter (PIE) or the 
Giniâ€“Simpson index. The index represents the probability that two 
individuals randomly selected from a sample will belong to different 
species. The value ranges between 0 and 1, with greater values 
representing greater sample diversity. The name of the output layer 
is composed of the basename + ginisimpson.

<h4>Inverse Simpson index (Simpson's Reciprocal Index)</h4>

An alternative way to overcome the problem of the counter-intuitive 
nature of Simpson's Index is to use  the inverse Simpson index, 
which is defined as <i>ID = 1 / D)</i>. The lowest value of this 
index is 1 and represent a community containing only one species. 
The higher the value, the greater the diversity. The maximum value 
is the number of species in the sample. The name of the output layer 
is composed of the basename + invsimpson.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

Note that if you are interested in the landscape diversity, you 
should have a look at the
<a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/grass70/manuals/addons/r.diversity.html">r.diversity</a>
addon or the various related r.li.* addons (see 
below). These functions requires one input layer and compute the 
diversity using a moving window.

<p>Currently when working with very large raster layers and many 
input layers, computations can take a long time. On the todo list: 
find a way to reduce this.

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

Suppose we have five layers, each representing number of 
individuals of a different species. To keep it simple, let's assume 
individuals of all five species are homogeneous distributed, with 
respectively 60, 10, 25, 1 and 4 individuals / raster cell densities.

<div class="code"><pre>
r.mapcalc "spec1 = 60"
r.mapcalc "spec2 = 10"
r.mapcalc "spec3 = 25"
r.mapcalc "spec4 = 1"
r.mapcalc "spec5 = 4"
</pre></div>

<p>Now we can calculate the renyi index for alpha is 0, 1 and 2 
(this should be 1.61, 1.06 and 0.83 respectively)

<div class="code"><pre>
r.series.diversity -r in=spec1,spec2,spec3,spec4,spec5 out=renyi alpha=0,1,2

r.info -r map=renyi_Renyi_0_0
min=1.6094379124341
max=1.6094379124341

r.info -r map=renyi_Renyi_1_0
min=1.05813420869358
max=1.05813420869358

r.info -r map=renyi_Renyi_2_0
min=0.834250021537946
max=0.834250021537946
</pre></div>

<p>You can also compute the species richness, shannon, inverse 
simpson and gini-simpson indices

<div class="code"><pre>
r.series.diversity -s -h -p -g in=spec1,spec2,spec3,spec4,spec5 out=biodiversity
</pre></div>

<p>The species richness you get should of course be 5. The shannon 
index is the same as the renyi index with alpha=1 (1.06). The 
inverse simpson and gini-simpson should be 2.3 and 0.57 
respectively. Let's check:

<div class="code"><pre>
r.info -r map=biodiversity_richness
min=5
max=5

r.info -r map=biodiversity_shannon
min=1.05813420869358
max=1.05813420869358

r.info -r map=biodiversity_invsimpson
min=2.30308613542147
max=2.30308613542147

r.info -r map=biodiversity_ginisimpson
min=0.5658
max=0.5658
</pre></div>
