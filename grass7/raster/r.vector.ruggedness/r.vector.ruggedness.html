<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em><b>r.vector.ruggedness</b></em> represents a measurement of terrain
ruggedness based on the methodology conceived by Sappington et al.
(2007). The measure is calculated by decomposing slope and aspect into
3-dimensional vectors, and calculating the resultant vector magnitude
within a user-specified moving window size, using <i>r.neighbors</i>.
The user can specify neighborhood size to measure ruggedness across
larger landscale scales. Neighborhood operations are performed using a
rectangular window shape.
