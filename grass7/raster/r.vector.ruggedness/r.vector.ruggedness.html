<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p><i>r.vector.ruggedness</i> represents a measurement of terrain ruggedness based on the methodology conceived by
    Sappington et al. (2007). The measure is calculated by decomposing slope and aspect into 3-dimensional vectors, and
    calculating the resultant vector magnitude within a user-specified moving window size using <i>r.neighbors</i>. The
    user can specify neighborhood size to measure ruggedness across larger scales. Neighborhood operations are
    performed using a rectangular window shape.</p>

<h2>MULTI-SCALE CALCULATION</h2>

<p>The <i>r.vector.ruggedness</i> tool provides an efficient approach of calculating the Vector Ruggedness Measure over
    multiple window sizes. The <i>size</i> argument accepts multiple answers (as a comma separated list), which will
    cause the tool to reuse the same slope, aspect and vector calculations, and apply them to the neighborhood
    operations that calculate the vector magnitudes. By default, both the calculation of the vectors and the vector
    magnitudes, including over different window sizes is performed in parallel using all available cores. To restrict
    parallel processing, the <i>nprocs</i> argument can be changed to use a smaller number of processing cores. When
    multiple sizes are used, the <i>output</i> raster name is appended with the window size. Optionally, pre-calculated
    slope and aspect maps (in degrees) can be used in the <i>slope</i> and <i>aspect</i> arguments to save
    computational time if the maps are already available.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

<p>This script was adapted from the original Sappington et al. (2007) script.</p>

<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>

<p>The examples are to be executed using the GRASS GIS sample North Carolina data set. To calculate the Vector
    Ruggedness Measure using a single neighborhood size:</p>

<div class="code"><pre>
    r.vector.ruggedness elevation=elevation size=3 output=vrm
</pre></div>

<p>For efficient calculations of the Vector Ruggedness Measure over multiple neighborhood sizes, the slope, aspect and
    their x, y, z vectors will be reused during the calculation. The output name will be appended with the neighborhood
    size in order to identify the output maps:</p>

<div class="code"><pre>
    r.vector.ruggedness elevation=elevation size=3,5,7,9,11 output=vrm
</pre></div>
