<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.rand.weight</em> generates a binary raster layer with a random
selection of raster cells which are assigned 1. The other cells are 
assigned NULL (or optionally 0). The change for a raster cell to get 
assigned a 1 (to get selected) depends on the weight (value) of that 
cell in the input weight layer.

<p>By default the script is run setting a random seed every time. To 
ensure that your results are reproducible you can set the seed value 
under the 'Sample options' tab. See the 'Random number generator 
initialization' in the r.mapcalc helpfile for more details.
 
<p>You can play with the probability for a cell to be selected by 
changing the minimum and/or maximum weights. The script will give a 
warning if the user defined minimum > minimum raster value or if the 
user defined maximum is smaller then the maximum raster value. The 
script will still run as the user may have set this values 
intentionally.

<p>You can also set the total number of sample points to be selected 
using the under the 'Sample options' tab. This can be done using an 
absolute number or as percentage (see the help file of the r.random 
function for more details).
