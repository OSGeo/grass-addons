<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.vif</em> This module will compute a stepwise variance inflation factor 
(VIF) and the square root of the VIF. The VIF quantifies how much 
the variance (the square of the estimate's standard deviation) of an 
estimated regression coefficient is increased because of 
collinearity. The square root of VIF is a measure of how much larger 
the standard error is, compared with what it would be if that 
variable were uncorrelated with the other predictor variables in the 
model. 

<p>By default the VIF is calculated for each variable. If the user 
sets a VIF threshold value (maxvif) the VIF will calculated again 
after removing the variable with the highest VIF. This will be 
repeated till the VIF is smaller than maxvif. This can thus be used 
to select a sub-set of variables for e.g., multiple regression 
analysis.

<p>The user has the option to compute the VIF over a random subset 
of the raster cells (to speed up computation). Like in the r.random 
module (which is used to select the random set of raster cells), the 
user may specify the quantity of random cells either as a positive 
integer (e.g., 10), or as a percentage of the raster map layer's 
cells (e.g., 10%, or 3.05%). Percentages less than one percent may 
be stated as decimals. 

<h2>Notes</h2>

This add-on doesn't work in GRASS 6.* as it depends on 
r.regression.multi, which is available in GRASS 7+ main only.
