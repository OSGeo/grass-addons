<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p><em>r.biodiversity</em> computes one or more biodiversity indici 
based on 2 or more input layers. Each layer should represents a 
species (or other categories being used), and its raster values the 
species count. The name of the output layers will consist of the 
base name provided by the user.

<p>Currently implemented are the Rényi entropy index and three 
specialized cases of the Renyi enthropy, viz.the species richness, the 
Shannon index and the Simpson index (Legendre & Legendre, 1998). 

<h4>The Renyi enthropy</h4>

This index uantify the diversity, uncertainty, or randomness of a 
system. The user can define the order of diversity by setting the 
order (<i>alpha</i>) value. The order of a diversity indicates its 
sensitivity to common and rare species. The diversity of order zero 
( <i>alpha</i> = 0)  is completely insensitive to species 
frequencies and is better known as species richness. Increasing the 
order diminishes the relative weights of rare species in the 
resulting index (Jost 2006, Legendre & Legendre 1998). The name of 
the output layer is composed of the basename + renyi + alpha.

<h4>Species richness</h4>

<p>The species richness is simply the count of the number of layers. 
It is a special case of the Reny enthropy: 

<div class="code"><pre>s = exp(R0)</pre></div>

whereby <i>s</i> is the species richness <i>R0</i> the renyi index 
for <i>alpha=0</i>. The name of the output layer is composed of the basename + 
richness.

<h4>Shannon index</h4>

<p>The Shannon (also called the Shannon-Weaver or Shannon-Wiener) 
index is defined as 

<div class="code"><pre>H = -sum(p_i x log(p_i))</pre></div>

where <i>p_i</i> is the proportional abundance of species <i>i</i>. 
The r.biodiversity uses the natural logarithm (one can also use 
other bases for the log, but that is currently not implemented, and 
doesn't make a real difference). Note the Shannon index is a special 
case of the Renyi enthropy for <i>alpha = 2<i>. The name of the 
output layer is composed of the basename + shannon.

<h4>Simpson (concentration) index</h4>

<p>The Simpson's index is defined as 

<div class="code"><pre>D = sum p_i^2</pre></div>. 

This is equivalent to 

<div class="code"><pre><pre>-1 * 1 / exp(R2)</pre></div>

with <i>R2</i> the renyi index for <i>alpha=2</i>. With this index, 
0 represents infinite diversity and 1, no diversity. The name of the 
output layer is composed of the basename + simpson.

<h4>Inverse Simpson index (Simpson's Reciprocal Index)</h4>

<p>D obtains small values in datasets of high diversity and large 
values in datasets of low diversity. This is counterintuitive 
behavior for a diversity index. An alternative is the inverse 
Simpson index, which is

<div class="code"><pre>ID = 1 / D)</pre></div>. 

The index represents the probability that two individuals randomly 
selected from a sample will belong to different species. The value 
ranges between 0 and 1, but now, the greater the value, the greater 
the sample diversity. The name of the output layer is composed of 
the basename + invsimpson.

<h4>Gini-Simpson index</h4>

<p>An alternative way to overcome the problem of the 
counter-intuitive nature of Simpson's Index is to use 

<div class="code"><pre>1 - D)</pre></div>. 

The lowest value of this index is 1 and represent a community 
containing only one species. The higher the value, the greater the 
diversity. The maximum value is the number of species in the sample. 
The name of the output layer is composed of the basename + 
ginisimpson.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

<p>Note that if you are interested in the landscape diversity, you 
should have a look at the <a href= 
"https://grass.osgeo.org/grass70/manuals/addons/r.diversity.html"> 
r.diversity</a> addon or the various related r.li.* addons (see 
below). These functions requires one input layer and compute the 
diversity using a moving window.

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

<p>Suppose we have five layers, each representing number of 
individuals of a different species. To keep it simple, let's assume 
individuals of all five species are homogeneous distributed, with 
respectively 60, 10, 25, 1 and 4 individuals / raster cell densities.

<div class="code"><pre>
r.mapcalc "spec1 = 60"
r.mapcalc "spec2 = 10"
r.mapcalc "spec3 = 25"
r.mapcalc "spec4 = 1"
r.mapcalc "spec5 = 4"
</pre></div>

Now we can calculate the renyi index for alpha is 0, 1 and 2 (this 
will give you 1.61, 1.06 and 0.83 respectively)

<div class="code"><pre>
r.biodiversity in=spec1,spec2,spec3,spec4,spec5 out=renyi alpha=0,1,2
</pre></div>

You can also compute the species richness, shannon, simpson, inverse 
simpson and gini-simpson indici

<div class="code"><pre>
r.biodiversity -s -h -d -p -g in=spec1,spec2,spec3,spec4,spec5 out=biodiversity
</pre></div>

The species richness you get should of course be 5. The shannon 
index is the same as the renyi index with alpha=1 (1.06). The 
simpson should be 0.43, and inverse simpson and gini-simpson will be 
2.3 and 0.57 respectively.
