<h2>OPTIONS</h2>
<DL>
<DT><b>input</b></DT>
<DD>Name of input raster map to be fuzified. This map may be of any type and may require null values. 
</DD>
<DT><b>points</b></DT>
<DD>A list containing 4 (A,B,C,D) or 2 A,B) points defining set boundaries. Points must not to be in map range, but it may lead to only 0 o 1 membership for the whole map. For "both" side parameters range between A and D defines base, but range between B and C core of the fuzzy set. Between A and B and C and D are set's boundaries. If side is "both" it require 4 points, else 2 points.

<h2>OUTPUTS</h2>
<DL>
<DT><b>output</b></DT>
<DD>Map containing membership value of original map. Map is alvays of type FCELLS and contains values from 0 (no membership) to 1 (full membership). Values between 0 and 1 indicate partial membership</DD>
</DL>
<h2>FUZZY SET PARAMETERS</h2>
<DL>
<DT><b>boundary</b></DT>
<DD>Parameter definied the shape of the fuzzy boundary. The default and most popular is S-shaped, linear, J-shaped and G-shaped boundaries are also available. The same boundaires are appled to the both sides.</DD>

<DT><b>shape</b></DT>
<DD>Optional shape modifier. Range from -1 to 1. The default value is 0 and shoud  not be changed in most of the time. The negative values indicate more dilatant set, the positive values more concentrate set. See description for details.
<center>
<h3>Impact of shape parameter on shape boundary:</h3>

</DD>
<DT><b>height</b></DT>
<DD>Optional height modifier. Range from 0 to 1. The default value is 1 and indicate full membership beteen points B and C. If height is lesser than one the maximum memebrship is equal to height. See image: Fuzzy set definition.</DD>

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<H4>Definition of fuzzy set</H4>
Fuzzy sets are sets whose elements have degrees of membership. Zadeh (1965) introduced Fuzzy sets as an extension of the classical notion of set. Classical  membership of elements in a set are binary terms: an element either belongs or does not belong to the set. Fuzzy set theory use the gradual assessment of the membership of elements in a set. A membership function valued in the real unit interval [0, 1]. Classical sets, are special cases of the membership functions of fuzzy sets, if the latter only take values 0 or 1. Classical sets are in fuzzy set theory usually called crisp sets. The fuzzy set theory can be used in a wide range of domains in which information is  imprecise, such as most of the GIS operations.


<h2>NOTES</H2>
<H4>Calculation of boundary shape</H4>
Depending on type of the boundary different equation are used to determine its shape:
<P>
<B>Linear:</B> the membership is calculated according following equation:<br>
<pre><code>
value  <=  A -> x = 0
A< value > B -> x = (value-A)/(B-A)
B <= value >= C -> x = 1
C< value > D -> x = (D-value)/(D-C)
value  >=  D -> x = 0

where x: membership
</code></pre>
<P>
<B>S-shaped:</B> it use following equation:
<pre><code>
sin(x * Pi/2)^m (for positive shape parameter)
1-cos(x * Pi/2)^m (for nagative shape parameter)

where x: membership, and 
m = 2^exp(2,shape) (for positive shape parameter)
m = 2^(1+shape) (for negative shape parameter)
where m: shape parameter.
</code></pre>

For default shape parameter = 0 m is = 2 whcich is most common parameter for that equation.

<P>
<B>G-shaped and J shaped:</B> it use following equations: 
<pre><code>
tan(x * Pi/4)^m (for J-shaped)
tan(x * Pi/4)^1/m (for G-shaped)

where x: membership, and 
m = 2^exp(2,shape) (for positive shape parameter)
m = 2^(1+shape) (for negative shape parameter)
where m: shape parameter.
</code></pre>
