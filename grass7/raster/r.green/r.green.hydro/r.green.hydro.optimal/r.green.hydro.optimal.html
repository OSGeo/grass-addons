<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<em>r.green.hydro.optimal</em> calculates the hydropower energy potential for each basin. Deciding the range of plant length and the distance between plants, the module returns a vector file with the intakes and the restitution of the river which maximize the power that can be produced.

<h2>NOTES</h2>
The power is defined as P=&eta;&rho;gQ&Delta;h where :<br>
&eta; is the efficiency of the plant <br>
&rho; the density of water (1000 kg/m<sup>3</sup>) <br>
g the gravity term (9,81 m/s<sup>2</sup>) <br>
Q the discharge of the river<br>
&Delta;h the gross head of the considered segment<br> <br>

The module maximizes the power over a given range by a brute-force search in order to examine all possible arrangements of Q and &Delta;h. Thus, the potential segments can be shorter than the maximum length plant chosen because it depends on the maximization of the product  Q * &Delta;h. <br>  <br>
The three input files have to give : the river considered, the discharge for each point of this river and the dtm to calculate the gross head. <br> <br>
For each potential segment, the potential power is given in kW in attribute. The categories are divided in range of segment lengths. Arms of river are distinguished by a number, as well as the plants on these arms.


<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>
These examples are based on the Pnam file which refers to the Gesso and Vermenagna Valley in Piedmont, Italy.<br><br>

Here is the vector file availablestreams of the interested streams. The river segments already exploited by an existing plant do not appear in the file.<br>

This command calculates the energy potential for a plant length range from 10 to 800 m and a distance between plants of 200m.<br><br>
