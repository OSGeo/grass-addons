<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.green</em> computes the residual energy potential of different renewable energies like biomass or hydropower.<br>
The tool is organized in the modules r.green.hydro and r.green.biomassfor which are composed of several programs considering different limits (e.g. theoretical, recommended, legal, technical, ecological and economic constraints).<br>
These different scenarios can be compared so that the residual energy potential and the suitable places for constructing a new power plant can be identified.<br>
All the modules of the tool r.green can be installed in GRASS as following:

g.extension r.green</pre></div>

<h2>NOTES</h2>

the basis for creating the modules to calculate the energy potential is shown in the following image:<br><br>
