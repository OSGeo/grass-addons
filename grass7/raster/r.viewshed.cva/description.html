<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.viewshed.cva</em> is a module that allows for the 
construction of "Cumulative Viewshed", or "visualscape" maps from a 
series of input points stored in a vector points map. The routine is 
a python wrapper script that iterative loops through each input 
point, calculating a viewshed map, and then creates an output map 
that is coded by the number of input locations that can "see" each 
cell. <em>r.viewshed.cva</em> uses the GRASS module <em>r.viewshed</em>
for the viewshed analysis. <it>r.viewshed</it> is very fast, 
thus allowing for a cumulative viewshed analysis to run in a 
reasonable amount of time. The final cumulative viewshed map is 
computed using the "count" method of <it>r.series</it>, rather than 
with mapcalc, as it better handles the null values in the individual 
constituent viewshed maps (and allows for interim viewshed maps to 
be coded in any way)

<h3>Options and flags:</h3>

<it>r.viewshed.cva</it> requires an input elevation map and an input 
vector points map.
There is currently only one native flag for <it>r.viewshed.cva</it> 
(-k), which allows you to keep the interim viewshed maps made for 
each input point. All other flags and options are inherited from 
r.viewshed (see the<it> r.viewshed</it> help page for more 
information on these).

<h2>NOTES</h2>

The input vector points map can be manually digitized (with <it>
v.digit</it>) over topographic or cultural features, or can be 
created as a series of random points (with <it>r.random</it> or <it>
v.random</it>). Note that using the flag -k allows you to keep any 
interim viewshed maps created during the analysis, and these resultant 
viewshed maps will be named according to the cat number of the original
input points. This is also useful for simple creating a large number
of individual viewsheds from points in a vector file.

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>
Undertake a cumulative viewshed analysis from a digitized vector points map of prominent peaks in a region:<br>

<div class="code"><pre>
g.region rast=elevation_10m_dem@PERMANENT -p
[use v.digit to digitize points]
r.viewshed.cva.py elev=elevation10m_demPERMANENT output=peaks_CVA_map \
  vect=prominent_peaks_points@PERMANENT x_column=x y_column=y \
  name_column=cat obs_elev=0.0 tgt_elev=1.75 max_dist=-1 mem=1500
</pre></div>


<br>Undertake a cumulative viewshed analysis from a 10% sample of landscape locations in a region:<br>

<div class="code"><pre>
g.region rast=elevation_10m_dem@PERMANENT
r.random input=elevation10m_demPERMANENT n=10% vector_output=rand_points_10p
r.viewshed.cva.py elev=elevation10m_demPERMANENT output=peaks_CVA_map \
  vect=rand_points_10p@PERMANENT x_column=x y_column=y \
  name_column=cat obs_elev=0.0 tgt_elev=1.75 max_dist=-1 mem=1500
</pre></div>
