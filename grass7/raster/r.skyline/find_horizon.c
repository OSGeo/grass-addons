   Revised by Mark Lake, 16/07/2007, for r.horizon in GRASS 6.x
   Written by Mark Lake, 15/07/2002, for r.horizon in GRASS 5.x

   NOTES
   To debug this file #define DEBUG in global_vars.h because you also
   need debug-only functions in list.c

   Bug fix on 14/08/20017 fixed failure to identify horizon in
   circumstances where the clockwise list of potentially covering cells
   ended in quad 4 but the potential horizon cell was on axis 1
