# Technical Debt

All issues and imperfections of the code should be documented in this
file.

The goal is to declare the technical debt as described by
[Easterbrook 2014](http://doi.org/10.1038/ngeo2283) or Wikipedia
contributors in
[Technical debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt).

The sections are based on sections in CHANGELOG. The version refers to
when the problem first occurred or was encountered. Entries are divided,
similarly to CHANGELOG, into what is missing and needs to be added (Add),
what requires a changes of the current code (Change) and what is an
issue which needs to be fixed (Fix).

Entries should be removed when resolved. Issue from tracker can be
optionally linked in an entry.

## 2019-10-29 - More raster generalizations

### Add

- We use the same type for index and size in Raster. We need to
  add size type parameter to allow for use of size_t and ssize_t
  together which is needed to fully map other types to Raster.
- Add container functions such `begin()` and `end()`.

### Change

- Use member initialization for all variables in all Raster constructors.
- Binary operators of raster should be functions.
  * Both scalar * raster and raster * scaler should be functions.

### Fix

- Add return code to raster class template test.
- Resolve the `-Wsign-compare` warnings.

## 2019-08-11 - Dispersal kernel rewrite

### Add

- Tests for kernel classes
- Documentation on how to use the kernel classes
- Support more spelling options for the types and wind directions.
- Better documentation for the short-long kernel.
- Better documentation or code related to reset() function of
  distributions.
- Add script for automatic code indentation.

### Change

- Indices and sizes should be template parameters as some matrix or
  raster libraries may use different types, e.g., Rcpp uses int as
  indices while Armadillo uses typedef for an unsigned integer.

## 2019-07-09

### Add

- Tests need to be written for weekly, daily, and multi-day timesteps for Date functionality.

## 2019-06-14

### Add

- Documentation to previously implemented treatments is missing

## 2018-09-14 - SEID and multiple host handling

### Add

- Exposed and Diseased classes should be added (need to think about how to handle in disperse).
- 3-D array for Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Diseased classes to handle multiple species up to N.
- Host-compentency score for handling multiple hosts.

## 2018-08-02 - PoPS Model Separation

### Add

- Most of mortality handling is now done outside of the library.
- A lot of post processing code may need to be repeated unless added to
  the library.
- There is no code in the library to help with seasonality.

## 2018-06-20 - Critical Temperature

### Add

- Add (rigorous) tests for the Raster class.
- Add more tests for the Date class.
- Documentation of the C++ functions and classes (use Doxygen).

### Change

- Naming and descriptions of parameters related to weather
  (coefficients versus the actual values)
- Naming of critical and actual temperature in code

### Fix

- Even after the upgrade to Raster class, there are still some legacy
  method names and integers instead of doubles (but does not influence
  computations).
- Numerous sign-compare warnings.
- Spelling in the code and comments.

## 2018-06-13 - Spotted Lanternfly

### Add

- Add SLF parameters to documentation.
- Update README.

## 2018-06-04 - Mortality Addition

### Add

- Add mortality to documentation.
- Update README.

### Change

- Mortality cohorts may require better name since the individual can be
  potentially also a cohort or stand.

### Fix

- Mortality-related infection cohort always updated in spore spread and
  need an additional parameter. However, the update is just a repeating
  previous line (perhaps some container optionally wrapping two images
  would be useful).

## 2017-09-05 - September 2017 Update

### Fix

- Dead code for the specific multiple host species.

## 2017-01-28 - January 2017 Status

### Add

- Image class is only for integers but the weather is floating point,
  so it needs a different treatment in code than other data.
- The date class needs abstraction for the leap years and days in month.
- Tests needed for the image class.

### Change

- Formatting of text and parameters for the date class (leading zeros).
- Create dedicated file for the direction enum and helper functions.
- Some of the Date class methods have still misleading names (e.g.,
  increased versus increase).
- Methods and functions should use underscores not camel case (using
  Python and GRASS GIS convention).
