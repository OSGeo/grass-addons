# Contributing to PoPS Core from outside of core development team.

The goal of this guide is to help you get up and contributing to PoPS Core and/or rPoPS as quickly as possible. The guide is divided into two main pieces:

1. Filing a bug report or feature request in an issue.
1. Suggesting a change via a pull request.

Please note that PoPS Core and rPoPS are released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](contributing/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By contributing to this project, you agree to abide by its terms.

## Issues

When filing an issue, the most important thing is to include a minimal 
reproducible example so that we can quickly verify the problem, and then figure 
out how to fix it. There are three things you need to include to make your 
example reproducible: required packages, data, code.
  
1.  The easiest way to include **data** is to include a link to a google drive folder containing your rasters and 
  
1.  Spend a little bit of time ensuring that your **code** is easy for others to
    read:
  
    * make sure you've used spaces and your variable names are concise, but
      informative
  
    * use comments to indicate where your problem lies
  
    * do your best to remove everything that is not related to the problem.  
     The shorter your code is, the easier it is to understand.

## Pull 

To contribute a change to PoPS Core or rPoPS, follow these steps:

1. Create a branch in git and make your changes.
1. Push branch to github and issue pull request (PR) if new feature add to a feature/new_feature branch.
1. Discuss the pull request.
1. Iterate until either we accept the PR or decide that it's not
   a good fit for this project.

Each of these steps are described in more detail below. This might feel 
overwhelming the first time you get set up, but it gets easier with practice. 

<!--
* [ ] Motivate the change in one paragraph, and include it in NEWS.
      In parentheses, reference your github user name and this issue:
      `(@ChrisJones687, #1234)`
* [ ] Check pull request only includes relevant changes.
* [ ] Use the [PoPS Core style guide](contributing_docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md).
* [ ] Update documentation to reflect your changes
* [ ] Add test (if a new feature or a bug fix that needs a new test)
* [ ] Add minimal example if new function in R.

Pull requests will be evaluated against a seven point checklist:

1.  __Motivation__. Your pull request should clearly and concisely motivate the
    need for change. Unfortunately neither Winston nor I have much time to
    work on ggplot2 these days, so you need to describe the problem and show
    how your pull request solves it as concisely as possible.


1.  __Only related changes__. Before you submit your pull request, please
    check to make sure that you haven't accidentally included any unrelated
    changes. These make it harder to see exactly what's changed, and to
    evaluate any unexpected side effects.

    Each PR corresponds to a git branch, so if you expect to submit
    multiple changes make sure to create multiple branches. If you have
    multiple changes that depend on each other, start with the first one
    and don't submit any others until the first one has been processed.

1.  __Use PoPS Core coding style__. Please follow the
    [PoPS Core style guide](contributing/STYLE_GUIDE.md). Maintaining
    a consistent style across the whole code base makes it much easier to
    jump into the code. If you're modifying existing code that
    doesn't follow the style guide, a separate pull request to fix the
    style would be greatly appreciated.

1.  If you're adding new parameters or a new function to the R package, you'll also need
    to document them with [roxygen](https://github.com/klutometis/roxygen).
    Make sure to re-run `devtools::document()` on the code before submitting.

1.  If fixing a bug or adding a new feature to the R package,
    please add a [testthat](https://github.com/r-lib/testthat) unit test.


This seems like a lot of work but don't worry if your pull request isn't perfect.
It's a learning process and members of the PoPS team will be on hand to help you
out. A pull request ("PR") is a process, and unless you've submitted a few in the
past it's unlikely that your pull request will be accepted as is. All PRs require
review and approval from at least one member of the PoPS development team 
before merge.

Finally, remember that PoPS is funded by USDA APHIS and maintained by the
NCSU Center for Geospatial Analytics. This means that changes that dramatically 
alter the way the model works will be maintained in a feature/branch for use by
others but may not be moved immediately/ever into the master branch because
multiple tools use that branch and need to be updated if major functional changes
occur in the Master branch.
