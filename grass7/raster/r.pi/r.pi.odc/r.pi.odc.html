<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.pi.odc</em> is part of the patch based fragmentation analysis
package r.pi.* (Patch Index). It computes omnidirectional connectivity
analysis between patches.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

Several output raster are generated with the defined <em>output</em> 
file name and a suffix of the information provided. All files named 
*.FP.* are providing information concerning the focus patch. All files 
named *.TP.* are providing informaton about the target patches.<br>

   ...<p>

The user must specify the names of the raster map layers to be used for 
<em>input</em> and <em>output</em>, the <em>keyval</em> the 
<em>ratio</em> (area/odd or odd/area) and <em>stats</em> used (i.e., 
average).
<p>
Within <em>r.pi.odc</em> the following setting have to be set:

<h3>keyval setting:</h3>

The <em>keyval</em> operator determines which category value is taken 
for the Patch Index analysis.

<h3>Ratio setting:</h3>

The <em>ratio</em> operators determine what measure is applied.

<h3>Neighbourhood level:</h3>

The <em>neighbor_level</em> operator determines which neighbourhood 
level is used. <em>0</em> produces output for the focus patch itself, 
<em>1</em> assigns the connectivity information of the first 
omnidirectional neighbours to the focus patch, hence the connectivity 
of the surrouding fragments. This value can be increased for analysing 
the more distant neighbours.

<h3>Output:</h3>

Various output files are autmatically created with the pattern $output.*

The ...


<em>FP</em> describes attributes of the fokus patch (area and area of 
the odd)

<em>TP</em> describes attributes of the target patch (all neighbouring 
patches around the FP) - separated by the statsmethod (average, median, 
variance, stddev)

<em>ratio</em> describes which ratio is taken for all TPs.

The output raster files are named accordingly:<br>

*.FP.area: size of the patch<br>
*.FP.odd: size of the isolation area<br>
*.FP.odd_area: ratio of size of patch and size of isolaton area<br>

*.TP.no: amount of neighbouring patches<br>
*.TP.area.avg: average size of all neighbouring patches<br>
*.TP.odd.avg: average size of all isolation areas of neighbouring patches<br>
*.TP.odd_area.avg: average ratio of isolation area to patch size<br>

*.diagram: (if flag -d active) isolation areas and border are depicted


<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>

An example for the North Carolina sample dataset:

<div class="code"><pre>
r.pi.odc input=landclass96 output=odc keyval=5 ratio=odd_area stats=average neighbor_level=0 -d
</pre></div>
