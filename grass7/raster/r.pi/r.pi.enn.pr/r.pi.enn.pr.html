<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

Patch relevance for Euclidean Nearest Neighbor patches.
<p>
<em>r.pi.enn.pr</em> computes distance and area
differences for the first NN after removal of patch i.


<h2>NOTES</h2>

The <em>keyval</em> operator determines which category value is taken for
the Patch Index analysis.
<p>
The <em>method</em> operators determine what measure is applied 
on the nth NN (area or distance).
<p>
Differences of distance/area after removal of patch i are provided as output as well as 
the amount of patches to be affected by its removal (percent) (PP) and
the amount of area in these patches (PA - Percent Area)

<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>

An example for the North Carolina sample dataset:
<p>
Analysing the differences (average) in distance when patch i of class 5 is removed:
<div class="code"><pre>
r.pi.enn.pr input=landclass96 output=dist_iter keyval=5 method=distance statmethod=average 
</pre></div>
