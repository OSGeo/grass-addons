<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.subdayprecip.design</em> computes reduction of subday design
precipitation series.

<p>
The tool uses methods of zonal statistics to compute average values of
design 24 hours precipitation for a selected area or for a spot. This
value is reduced to the chosen length design rain for selected period
of repetition.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

Subday design precipitation series are important for hydrological
modelling and soil erosion problems in a small catchment scale when
designing common measures for promoting water retention, landscape
drainage systems, etc.

<p>
First automatization has been implemented by well-known method
which is based on reduction of 24 hours design precipitation to
shorter time. GIS is used for spatial supervised classification of
point values of specified repetition periods (2, 10, 20, 50 a 100
years) over the area of the Czech Republic.
