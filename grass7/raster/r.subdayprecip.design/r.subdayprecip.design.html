<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.subdayprecip.design</em> computes subday design precipitation
totals based on Hradek's method of reduction of daily maximums to
chosen duration.

<p>
The tool uses methods of zonal statistics to compute average values of
24 hours precipitation amounts of specified return period for a
provided area or a spot. Rasters of daily maxima were derived from
statistics published by Samaj et al. in 1985, which were based on
precipitation series observed in 1901-1980. Calculated average value (in millimeters)
is then reduced to the chosen length of design rain event.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

Subday design precipitation series are important for hydrological
modelling and soil erosion problems in a small catchment scale when
designing common measures for promoting water retention, landscape
drainage systems, flood mitigation measures etc.

<p>
First automatization has been implemented by well-known method
which is based on reduction of 24 hours design precipitation to
shorter time. GIS can used for spatial supervised classification of
point values of specified return periods (2, 10, 20, 50 and 100
years).
