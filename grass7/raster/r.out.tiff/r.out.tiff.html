<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

Note: this module is superseded by <a href="r.out.gdal.html">r.out.gdal</a>.
<p>

<em>r.out.tiff</em> converts a GRASS raster map to a TIFF raster map. Output may
be 8 or 24 bit (TrueColor).  Optionally, a TIFF World file compatible with
ESRI's and other's products may be output.

<p>The program prompts the user for the name of a GRASS raster map, an output
TIFF file, whether an 8 or 24 bit format is desired, and whether or not to
create a TIFF world file.  Currently only uncompressed, packpit, or deflate
TIFF files are written.  These output formats are known to be compatible
with r.in.tiff.

<p>The output filename will always have the suffix <code>.tif</code>, and the Tiff World
file (if requested) <code>.tfw</code>. Any <code>.tif</code> or
<code>.tiff</code> suffix (case insensitive) specified in the output filename 
will be discarded.

<p>When writing with "-l" option, tiles are written at 128x128 pixels.  For
programs that can utilize tiles, it can help speed up some drawing
operations.

<p>The user may adjust region and resolution before export using
<a href="g.region.html">g.region</a>.

<p>A better choice to export GRASS raster data might be
<a href="r.out.gdal.html">r.out.gdal</a>.
