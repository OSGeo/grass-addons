<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.bearing.distance</em> computes the bearing and/or straight-line
distance from a point location to all non-NULL cells in a raster map.
Optionally, the bearing returned in each non-NULL cell may be:

  <ul>
    <li>the actual bearing measured from the point location;</li>
    <li>the difference between that bearing and a reference
    bearing;</li>
    <li>one of two measures of the extent to which the bearing is or
    is not orthogonal to the reference bearing.</li>
  </ul>
  
<p> By default, the <b>bearing</b> map records the bearing of a
straight line projected from the point location to each non-NULL cell
in the input map.  If the <b>-r</b> flag is set then this map records
the reverse bearing, i.e. that of a straight line projected from each
non-NULL cell towards the point location.  The point location itself
is coded NULL, irrespective of whether it was NULL or non-NULL in the
input map.

<p>If a <b>reference_bearing</b> is specified without the <b>-a</b>
or <b>-b</b> flags then the bearing map will by default record the
bearing relative to the reference bearing.  This relative bearing is
the clockwise difference between the reference bearing and the bearing
that would otherwise have been recorded.  For example: if the bearing
is 315 degrees and the reference bearing 270 degrees, the relative
bearing would be +45 degrees; if the bearing is 45 degrees and the
reference bearing 270 degrees, the relative bearing would be +135
degrees.

<p>If a <b>reference_bearing</b> is specified along with the <b>-a</b>
flag then the bearing map will record the bearing relative to an axis
defined by the reference bearing, such that if the bearing is aligned
(or 180 degrees opposite) the reference bearing the difference will be
zero degrees, and if it is orthogonal the difference will be +90
degrees.

<p>If a <b>reference_bearing</b> is specified along with the <b>-b</b>
flag then the bearing map will record the signed bearing relative to
an axis defined by the reference bearing, such that if the bearing is
aligned (or 180 degrees opposite) the reference bearing the difference
will be zero degrees, if it is orthogonal in a clockwise direction the
difference will be +90 degrees, and if it is orthogonal in an
anticlockwise direction the difference will be -90 degrees.

<p>The <b>distance</b> map records the straight-line distance from the
point location to each non-NULL cell in the input map.  The distance
is computed using the geographic coordinates of the point location and
the geographic coordinates of the centre of each non-NULL map cell.

<p>The <b>segment</b> map records which azimuthal segment the bearing
(or relative bearing) falls in.  The <b>-e</b> flag determines whether
4 or 8 segments are returned.  The <b>-s</b> flag determines whether
segments are centred on a bearing (or relative bearing) of zero
degrees, or start clockwise from zero degrees.

<p>The <b>csv_seg</b> file is a plain text CSV file which records the
count and percentage of cells falling in each of the segments.

<p>The <b>csv_ax</b> file is only available if an axial relative
bearing has been requested by setting the <b>-a</b> or <b>-b</b>
flags.  In the case of an axial relative bearing (<b>-a</b>) this
plain text CSV file records the count of cells whose relative bearing
(&theta;) falls in each of 5 ranges: &theta; = 0; 0 < &theta; &le;
22.5; 22.5 < &theta; &le; 45; 45 < &theta; &le; 67.5; 67.5 < &theta;
&le; 90.  It also records the mean value of &theta;.  In the case of a
signed axial relative bearing (<b>-b</b>) this file distinguishes
positive and negative values of &theta;.  It also records separate
means and standard deviations of the positive and negative values of
&theta; in addition to an overall mean and standard deviation.


<h2>NOTES</h2>

This module was originally written for an archaeological investigation
of the orientation of viewsheds from prehistoric burial mounds, but it
will be useful for visibility analysis in a range of academic
disciplines, as well as planning and environmental management.
Indeed, it potentially has application for any kind of analysis which
involves a set of non-NULL cells that are somehow related to a point
location.

<p>In the case of visibility analysis, the <b>-r</b> flag will be
particularly useful when a viewshed has been produced with observer
and target offsets set so as to compute the visibility from each cell
back towards the point location set as the 'viewpoint'.  With
the <b>-r</b> flag the bearing returned will similarly be that from
each cell in the viewshed back towards the point location of interest.
  
<p>The code does not currently deal with Lat/Long databases.

<p>The module only runs when the current region has integer resolution
(since the algorithm is not robust in cases where resolution is
non-integer).  The code might work satisfactorily when the map
resolution in non-integer, but this has not been rigorously checked.
