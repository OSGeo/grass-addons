<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.resamp.tps</em> performs multivariate thin plate spline
interpolation with regularization. The <b>input</b> is a raster 
map to be resampled to a higher resolution or where NULL cells need to 
be interpolated. Output is a raster map. Optionally, several 
raster maps can be specified to be used as covariables which will 
improve results in areas with few points. Raster maps to be used as 
covariables need to be provided separately matching the grid geometry 
of the <b>input</b> raster map with the <b>icovars</b> option and 
matching the grid geometry of the <b>output</b> raster map with the 
<b>ocovars</b> option. The module can be regarded as a combination of 
a multiple regression and spline interpolation.

<p>
The <b>min</b> options specifies the minimum number of points to be 
used for interpolation. <em>r.resamp.tps</em> always performs tiled 
local TPS interpolation. Tile sizes are variable and dependent on the 
extents of the <b>min</b> nearest neighbors when a new tile is generated.

<p>
The <b>smooth</b> option can be used to reduce the influence of the 
splines and increase the influence of the covariables. Without 
covariables, the resulting surface will be smoother. With covariables 
and a large smooting value, the resulting surface will be mainly 
determined by the multiple regression component.

<p>
The <b>overlap</b> option controls how much tiles are overlapping when 
the <b>min</b> option is smaller than the numer of input points. 
Tiling artefacts occur with low values for the <b>min</b> option and the 
<b>overlap</b> option. Increasing both options will reduce tiling 
artefacts but processing will take more time.

<p>
The module works best with evenly spaced points. In case of 
highly unevenly spaced points, e.g. remote sensing data with gaps due 
to cloud cover, the module will take a long time to finish. For data 
with large gaps, it is recommended to use first a different 
interpolation method and then optionally use <em>r.resamp.tps</em> with 
the <b>smooth</b> option to identify outliers (difference between the 
output of <em>r.resamp.tps</em> and the data interpolated with a 
different method).

<p>
When using covariables, outliers might be created if the values of the 
covariables of the current output cell are far outside the observed 
range of covariables, or if the linear regression component of the TPS 
interpolation for the covariables does not provide a good solution. Two 
methods are provided to avoid outliers caused by covariables. The first 
method (<em>lmfilter</em>) will discard covariables if R squared is 
larger than the value provided with the <em>lmfilter</em> option. The 
second method (<em>epfilter</em>) will discard covariables if the 
current value of a covariable is outside the observed range of 
covariables by a factor of (<em>epfilter</em>). The <em>epfilter</em> 
option typically results in more interpolations using the supplied 
covariables than the <em>lmfilter</em> option when both are adjusted to 
reject the same outliers.

<p>
The <b>memory</b> option controls only how much memory should be used 
for the covariables and the intermediate output. The data needed for 
TPS interpolation are always completely loaded to memory.
