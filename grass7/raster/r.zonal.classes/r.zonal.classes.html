<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
  
<em>r.zonal.classes</em> computes class 
proportions and majority class (mode) of a "cover layer" 
(<b>raster</b>) - e.g., a land cover map - according to how it 
intersects with areas/objects in a "base layer" (<b>zone_map</b>). 
Areas are defined by adjacent pixels with the same value. Such areas 
can be the output of <em><a href="r.clump.html">r.clump</a></em> or 
<em><a href="i.segment.html">i.segment</a></em>.

<p>This function is similar to what <em><a href="r.stats.zonal.html">r.stats.zonal</a></em> 
performs, but is intended to be used on integer values raster (CELL 
type) instead of floating-point as in <em>r.stats.zonal</em>. 

<h2>NOTES</h2>

The user can choose between output in the form of a 
vector map of the areas contained in the "base layer" with the 
statistics of the "cover layer" stored in the attribute table 
(<b>vectormap</b>) and/or in the form of a CSV text file 
(<b>csvfile</b>).

<p>
By default, the function compute the majority 
class as well as class proportions for each zone in the "base layer". 
If only the majority class or class proportion is needed, it can be 
specified by using the <b>statistics</b> parameter.
<p>
By default the 
function provides the ratio of classes (total = 1) but the <b>-p</b> 
flag allow to provide percentages (total = 100). The number of decimals 
is set to 5 by default and can be changed using the <b>decimals</b> 
parameter.
<p>
By default, the name of columns for proportions follows 
this logic : 'prop_XX' where XX is the class of the "base layer". The 
user can add a prefix to proportion columns using the <b>prefix</b> 
parameter.
<p>
The function works under the current computation region. 
The <b>-r</b> flag can be used to define computational region based on 
the "base layer" for the processing.
<p>
By default, the function 
ignore NULL values. This behaviour can be reverted using the <b>-n</b> 
flag.
<p>
By default, the output contains only columns for classes that 
actually exist in the "base layer" under the current computational 
region. This can create problems when the user run the function on 
different computational region with the aim to merge statistic tables 
at the end, because some classes could be present under some 
computational regions and absent on others. For this reason, the 
<em>classes_list</em> parameter allows to force the output to provide 
statistics also for classes no present under the current computation 
region. In this case, the proportion values added for this class are 
set to zero. This is particularly useful when the function is used in 
multiple processing - sequentially or in parallel - to ensure all the 
output will have the same number (and order) of columns. 

<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>

On North Carolina sample dataset:

<div class="code"><pre>
# Define region 
g.region raster=zipcodes

# Get majority class and classes proportion of 'landuse96_28m'
# for each zone/object in 'zipcode' layer 
r.zonal.classes zone_map=zipcodes raster=landuse96_28m csvfile=output.csv \
  vectormap=vect_output prefix=lu

# Display attributes table
v.db.select map=vect_output
