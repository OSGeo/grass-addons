<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.modis.download</em> downloads selected MODIS products. The module
can download several tiles at once and also multiple observation days
for each MODIS product.

<h2>NOTE</h2>

The connection to the FTP data site requires a default login.
To set the username and password options the user has to use
the <em>setting</em> option; a file can be used (in this case the first
line is the username, usually it is 'anonymous', in the second line
the password is given, usually the user's e-mail address):
<div class="code"><pre>
  your_NASA_FTP_username
  your_NASA_FTP_password
</pre></div>
As alternative, the user can pass the values from standard input.
<p>

<b>Warning</b>: The NASA policy does not permit to open more then ten
connections in parallel with their FTP server. Hence no more than ten
process of <em>r.modis.download</em> should run at the same time.
<p>
By default the downloaded files are stored in the path where the setting
file is saved. The user can change this directory with <em>folder</em>
option. The user has <!-- NOT?? --> to set the <em>folder</em> option if
user and password are sent by standard input.
<p>
The time for the download depends on the number of requested tiles, days
and the type of the MODIS product. For example, the NDVI product ranges 
from 5 MB to 270 MB and the LST product ranges from 2 MB to 21 MB.

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

To download the MODIS LST product from the Terra satellite using the default
options and setting the user and password by standard input, launch:
<div class="code"><pre>
r.modis.download setting=-
</pre></div>

Reading the user and password options from file:
<div class="code"><pre>
r.modis.download setting=/home/user/.grass7/r.modis/SETTING
</pre></div>

To download LST Terra product using the default options and changing
the starting and ending dates to custom values:
<div class="code"><pre>
r.modis.download setting=/home/user/.grass7/r.modis/SETTING startday=2011-05-01 endday=2011-05-31
</pre></div>

To downlad another product (for example <em>Snow eight days 500 m</em>),
with other default options:
<div class="code"><pre>
r.modis.download setting=/home/user/.grass7/r.modis/SETTING product=snow_terra_eight_500
</pre></div>

To use <em>r.modis.download</em> in a script with one of the other module
the user has to set the <em>-g</em> flag to return the name of the file
containing a list of downloaded HDF names:
<div class="code"><pre>
r.modis.download -g setting=/home/user/.grass7/r.modis/SETTING startday=2011-05-01 endday=2011-05-31
</pre></div>
