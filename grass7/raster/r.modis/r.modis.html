<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

The <em>r.modis</em> suite is a toolset to import MODIS satellite data in GRASS GIS. 
It uses the <a href="http://gis.cri.fmach.it/development/pyModis">pyModis</a>
library and the <a
href="https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/lpdaac/tools/modis_reprojection_tool"> MODIS
Reprojection Tool</a> software to convert, mosaik and process MODIS data.
It requires the <a
href="https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/lpdaac/tools/modis_reprojection_tool">MODIS
Reprojection Tool</a> to be installed while <a
href="http://gis.cri.fmach.it/development/pyModis">pyModis</a> is
included in the <em>r.modis</em> suite.
The suite offers three modules as interface with MODIS data. Each modules
is dedicated to for a specific operation.
It can download several MODIS products, those by tiles and observation days from 
the releated NASA FTP server. It process Level 2 data using the r.modis.process module.
It also import Level 3 (georeferenced) products either as single image or as daily mosaik.

<h4>Products</h4>
The products already supported: 
<ul>
  <li>Land Surface Temperature daily (Terra): product provides per-pixel temperature and emissivity values in a sequence of swath-based to grid-based global products. The MODIS/Terra LST/E Daily L3 Global 1 km Grid product (MOD11A1), is tile-based and gridded in the Sinusoidal projection, and produced daily at 1 km spatial resolution. </li>
  <li>Land Surface Temperature daily (Aqua): product provides per-pixel temperature and emissivity values in a sequence of swath-based to grid-based global products. The MODIS/Aqua LST/E Daily L3 Global 1 Km Grid product (MYD11A1), is tile-based and gridded in the Sinusoidal projection, and produced daily at 1 Km spatial resolution.</li>
  <li>NDVI sixteen days (Terra): MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) complements NOAA's Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) NDVI products and provides continuity for time series historical applications. data are provided every 16 days at 250-meter spatial resolution as a gridded level-3 product (MOD13Q1) in the Sinusoidal projection.</li>
  <li>Snow eight days: </li>
</ul>
