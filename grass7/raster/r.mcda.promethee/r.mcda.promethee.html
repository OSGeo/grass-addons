<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.mcda.promethee</em> is the implementation of the a multicriteria decision analysis based on PROMETHEE algorithm (J.P. Brans and P. Vincke (1985). "A preference ranking organisation method:The PROMETHEE method for MCDM". Management Science) in GRASS GIS environment. 
It is one of the available tools in the r.mcda suite. It requires as an input the list of raster representing the criteria to be assessed in the multicriteria evaluation and the vector of weights to be assigned. 
Every single cell of the GRASS region is considered as one of the possible alternatives to evaluate and it is described with
the value assumed for the same cell by the raster used as criteria. There
are three output files. One represents the spatial distribution of the
concordance index, the other one of the discordance index. The optimal
solution is the one presenting the maximum concordance value and the minimum
discordance value at the same time.


<h2>NOTES</h2>
The module does not standardize the raster-criteria. Therefore, they must
be prepared before by using, for example, r.mapcalc. The weights vector
is always normalized so that the sum of the weights is 1.
