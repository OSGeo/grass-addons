<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

The <em>r.out.legend</em> script provides a quick way to create a smoothed
legend image for floating point raster maps (continuous values as opposed
to categories), with the dimensions and resolution required. Optionally,
a histogram can be added along side the legend by setting the -d flag. In
addition, most option for d.label are available in this addon as well.
The legend can be saved as
<a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/grass75/manuals/pngdriver.html">PNG</a>,
<a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/grass75/manuals/psdriver.html">PS</a>
(postscript), BMP, PPM, PDF AND SVG. The latter four are supported
through the Cairo driver (see Notes). The images can be used to add
a continuous legends in maps created in e.g., QGIS composer or as
part of a Google Earth map.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

The user is required to set the dimensions of the legend bar. This
does not include the category values and histogram. Both will thus add to the
size of the output image. The size of the output image in pixels and the
unit set by the user is given in the console (see example 1).

<p>
Note that one can use category maps as input, but <em>
r.out.legend</em> will still create a smooth legend (by setting the
-f flag, see <em>d.legend</em>).

<p>
The user may create a horizontal legend by making the box wider
than it is tall. Note that for vertical legends labels are placed to
the right of the legend box. For horizontal legends the text will
be places below the legend.

<p> The -d flag is used to display a histogram distribution along
side the legend. For vertical legends, the histogram will be placed
left of the legend; if horizontal, it will be placed above the
legend bar. The histogram is 1.75 x the width (or height if
horizontal) of the legend bar. This thus adds to the final width of
the output image. Note that the statistics are calculated on the
current computational region settings set by g.region. The default
range however covers the entire natural bounds of the input map. If
the histogram appears empty, check your region settings.

<p>
The script is a wrapper of
<a href="d.legend"> d.legend</a>.
For detailed explanations of the different options,
see the manual pages of this functions. To find out the fonts
available on your system, you can run <a href="d.font">d.font -l</a>. For
a more interactive way to generate legend images, you can also try
<a href="ps.map">ps.map</a>.

<p>
With file type set to 'png', the png driver is used to create
the image. An alternative way to create a png image file is to set
as file type 'cairo' and provide an output file name with as
extension '.png'. This will use the cairo driver to generate the png
image. One advantage of the cairo driver is that it uses
anti-aliasing, which might give nicer results (smoother lines and
numbers). Compare the output for example 1 and 4.

<p> The default resolution is 300 px/inch (ppi), except when the unit is
set to <em>px</em>, in which case the default resolution is set to
96 ppi.

<p>
If the output image is in png or jpg format, the addon will attempt to set
the print resolution of the image so that other programs, such as Libreoffice
or Word document, know the intended size of the image. It uses the Python
Imaging Library
(<a href="http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/">PIL</a>) to do so. If not
installed this step will silently be skipped. However, note that the dimensions
of the image (in the user-defined unit, and based on the user-defined image
resolution) will be printed to the console.

<p>
The <em>range</em> option lets the user define the limits of the
legend. Note however that the color scale will remain faithful to
the values as defined with r.colors.

<p>
The <a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/grass64/manuals/cairodriver.html">
Cairo driver</a> generates PNG, BMP, PPM, PS, PDF or SVG images
using the Cairo graphics library. The image format is selected from
the extension of the output file. For this option to work, GRASS has
to be configured with CAIRO support (if you compile GRASS yourself,
use --with-cairo when configuring GRASS).

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

The raster layers in the examples below are from the
<a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/download/sample-data/">North Carolina
sample data set</a>.

<h3>Example 1</h3>

Note that because width > height, the legend is
printed horizontal, with the labels below the legend bar.

<div class="code"><pre>
r.out.legend raster=elevation file=r_out_legend_1.png filetype=png \
    dimensions=4,0.4 labelnum=3 fontsize=7 unit="cm" resolution=150
</pre></div

<p><img src="r_out_legend_1.png">

<p>
The dimensions (width and height) of the image are printed to the console.

<div class="code"><pre>
----------------------------
File saved as r_out_legend_1.png
The image dimensions are:
285px wide and 49px heigh
at a resolution of 150 ppi this is:
4.826 cm x 0.8382 cm
----------------------------
</pre></div>

<h3>Example 2</h3>

Same as above, but the font is set to comic and the
background color us set to grey.

<div class="code"><pre>
r.out.legend raster=elevation file=r_out_legend_2.png filetype=png \
    dimensions=300,20 labelnum=3 fontsize=10 unit="px" \
    font=comic bgcolor=grey
</pre></div>

<p><img src="r_out_legend_2.png">

<h3>Example 3</h3>

Like example 1, but without the raster values
printed (done by setting fontsize to 0).

<div class="code"><pre>
r.out.legend raster=elevation file=r_out_legend_3.png filetype=png \
    dimensions=300,20 labelnum=3 fontsize=0 unit="px"
</pre></div>

<p><img src="r_out_legend_3.png">

<h3>Example 4</h3>

Like example 1, but using the cairo driver to create the png image.
The difference is that the cairo driver uses anti-aliasing.

<div class="code"><pre>
r.out.legend raster=elevation file=r_out_legend_4.png filetype=cairo \
    dimensions=4,0.4 labelnum=3 fontsize=7 unit="cm" resolution=150
</pre></div

<p><img src="r_out_legend_4.png">

<p>
The dimensions (width and height) of the image:

<div class="code"><pre>
----------------------------
File saved as r_out_legend_4.png
The image dimensions are:
286px wide and 50px heigh
at a resolution of 150 ppi this is:
4.84293333333 cm x 0.855133333333 cm
----------------------------
</pre></div>

<h3>Example 5</h3>

Like example 4, but adding a histogram. Note that the histogram adds
to the size of the image (while the dimensions of the bar remain the
same as in the previous example).

<div class="code"><pre>
r.out.legend raster=elevation file=r_out_legend_5.png filetype=cairo \
    dimensions=4,0.4 labelnum=3 fontsize=7 unit="cm" resolution=150 -d
</pre></div

<p><img src="r_out_legend_5.png">

<p>
The dimensions (width and height) of the image:

<div class="code"><pre>
----------------------------
File saved as r_out_legend_5.png
The image dimensions are:
286px wide and 92px heigh
at a resolution of 150 ppi this is:
4.84293333333 cm x 1.56633333333 cm
----------------------------
</pre></div>
