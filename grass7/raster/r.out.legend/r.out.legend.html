<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

The <em>r.out.legend</em> script provides a convenient way 
to quickly create a smoothed legend image for floating point raster maps 
(continous values as opposed to categories), with the dimensions and 
resolution required. It is furthermore possible to set the font (default 
is 'Arial') and font size (default=10). The legend can be saved as 
<a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/grass64/manuals/pngdriver.html">PNG</a>, 
<a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/grass64/manuals/psdriver.html">PS</a> 
(postscript), BMP, PPM, PDF AND SVG. The latter four are supported through the 
Cairo driver (see Notes). The images can be used to add a continuous 
legends in maps created in e.g., QGIS composer or as part of a 
Google Earth map.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

The user is required to set the dimensions of the legend bar. This 
does not include the category values, which will thus add to the 
size of the output image. The size of the output image in pixels and the
unit set by the user is given in the console (see example 1).

<p>
Note that one can use category maps as input, but <em>
r.out.legend</em> will still create a smooth legend (by setting the 
-f flag, see <em>d.legend</em>). 

<p>
The script is a wrapper of <a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/grass71/manuals/d.mon.html">d.mon</a> 
and <a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/grass71/manuals/d.legend.html"> d.legend</a>. 
For detailed explanations of the different options, 
see the manual pages of these two functions. To find out the fonts 
available on your system, you can run <a href="d.font">d.font -l</a>. For 
a more interactive way to generate legend images, you can also try 
<a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/grass70/manuals/ps.map.html">ps.map</a>.

<p>
With file type set to 'png', the png driver is used to create 
the image. An alternative way to create a png image file is to set 
as file type 'cairo' and provide an output file name with as 
extension '.png'. This will use the cairo driver to generate the png 
image. One advantage of the cairo driver is that it uses 
anti-aliasing, which might give nicer results (smoother lines and 
numbers). Compare the output for example 1 and 4.

<p>
The user may create a horizontal legend by making the box wider 
than it is tall. Note that for vertical legends labels are placed to 
the right of the legend box. For horizontal legends the text will 
be places below the legend.

<p> The default resolution is 300 px/inch (ppi), except when the unit is 
set to <em>px</em>, in which case the default resolution is set to 
96 ppi. 

<p>
It is important to realize that setting the resolution will 
determine the height and width of your image in pixels. It does not, 
however, set the image print resolution. Other programs, like 
Libreoffice, Word or the QGIS print composer will therefore not know 
the intended image print resolution. This means you will have to set the
image size manually in the document. The exact dimention of the output
file is given in the console.

<p>
The <em>range</em> option lets the user define the limits of the 
legend. Note however that the color scale will remain faithful to 
the values as defined with r.colors.

<p>
The <a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/grass64/manuals/cairodriver.html">Cairo driver</a> 
generates PNG, BMP, PPM, PS, PDF or SVG images 
using the Cairo graphics library. The image format is selected from 
the extension of the output file. For this option to work, GRASS has 
to be configured with CAIRO support (if you compile GRASS yourself, 
use --with-cairo when configuring GRASS). 

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

The raster layers in the examples below are from the 
<a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/download/sample-data/">North Carolina 
sample data set</a>. 

<h3>Example 1</h3>

Note that because width > height, the legend is 
printed horizontal, with the labels below the legend bar.

<div class="code"><pre>
r.out.legend raster=elevation file=r_out_legend_1.png filetype=png \
    dimensions=4,0.4 labelnum=3 fontsize=7 unit="cm" resolution=150
</pre></div

<p><img src="r_out_legend_1.png">

<p>
The dimensions (width and height) of the image are printed to the console.

<div class="code"><pre>
----------------------------
File saved as r_out_legend_1.png
The image dimensions are:
282px wide and 46px heigh
at a resolution of 150 ppi this is:
4.7752 cm x 0.7874 cm
----------------------------
</pre></div>

<h3>Example 2</h3>

Same as above, but the font is set to comic and the
background color us set to grey.

<div class="code"><pre>
r.out.legend raster=elevation file=r_out_legend_2.png filetype=png \
    dimensions=300,20 labelnum=3 fontsize=10 unit="px" \
    font=comic bgcolor=grey
</pre></div>

<p><img src="r_out_legend_2.png">

<h3>Example 3</h3>

Like example 1, but without the raster values 
printed (done by setting fontsize to 0).

<div class="code"><pre>
r.out.legend raster=elevation file=r_out_legend_3.png filetype=png \
    dimensions=300,20 labelnum=3 fontsize=0 unit="px"
</pre></div>

<p><img src="r_out_legend_3.png">

<h3>Example 4</h3>

Like example 1, but using the cairo driver to create the png image. 
The difference is that the cairo driver uses anti-aliasing.

<div class="code"><pre>
r.out.legend raster=elevation file=r_out_legend_4.png filetype=cairo \
    dimensions=4,0.4 labelnum=3 fontsize=7 unit="cm" resolution=150
</pre></div

<p><img src="r_out_legend_4.png">
