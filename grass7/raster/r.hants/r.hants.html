<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.hants</em> performs a harmonic analysis of time series in order to 
estimate missing values and identify outliers. For each input map, an 
output map with the suffix <em>suffix</em> (default: _hants) is created.

<p>
The option <b>nf</b>, number of frequencies, should be carefully chosen. 
Different numbers of frequencies should be tested first on a small test 
region before running the module on the full region. As a rule of thumb, 
the number of frequencies should be at least 
<em>estimated periodicity + 3</em>, e.g. for NDVI with an annual cycle 
(one peak per year), the number of frequencies should be at least 4 when 
analysing one year. If two peaks are assumed per year, the number of 
frequencies should be at least 5 when analysing one year.

<p>The number of frequencies should not be too large, either. With a large 
number of frequencies, outliers can no longer be identified because the 
fit is &quot;too good&quot;, i.e. outliers can be represented by the 
estimates of the curve. Moreover, the number of frequencies should be 
smaller than <em>n input maps / 2</em> if missing values should be 
reconstructed.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

The optional <em>amplitude</em> and <em>phase</em> output maps contain 
the amplitude and phase for each frequency. The amplitude maps can be 
used to identify the dominant frequency with <em>r.series 
method=max_raster</em>. The baseline frequeny (base period) has the 
suffix <em>.0</em>, its first harmonic has the suffix <em>.1</em>, its 
second harmonic has the suffix <em>.2</em>, etc. The value of the 
output of <em>r.series method=max_raster</em> is identical to the 
number of the suffix. With the <em>amplitude</em> output maps for NDVI 
input, this can be used to determine the number of peaks in vegetation 
growth within the base period, where 0 (zero) means that the dominant 
frequency is the base period, i.e. one peak per base period.

<p>
HANTS operates in time, i.e. it looks at the time series of each cell. 
To fit a harmonic curve, it requires that the time series of each cell 
has a minimum amount of valid data. The number of valid observations 
must always be greater than or equal to the number of parameters that 
describe the harmonic curve (2 x nf - 1). The user can decide to use 
more observations than this minimum required. The option <b>dod</b> 
(degree of over-determination) is the minimum number of &quot;extra&quot; 
valid observations that should be considered to fit the curve. This 
parameter is optional, but it is recommended to be set.

<p>
In general, HANTS discards some information trying to represent the input
time series with a limited number of sine/cosine functions. Therefore,
most of the times, 1) it does not provide an exact match with the input
data and, 2) it produces a smoothed output. With more frequencies, it is
possible to get a better match with the input data, but also potential
overshoots. The latter can be alleviated by setting dod &gt; 0 at the
cost of further smoothing in the output.

<p>
The <em>range</em> parameter can be set to <em>low,high</em> thresholds:
values outside of this range are treated as NULL. The <em>low,high</em> 
thresholds are floating point, so use <em>-inf</em> or <em>inf</em> for 
a single threshold (e.g., <em>range=0,inf</em> to ignore negative 
values, or <em>range=-inf,-200.4</em> to ignore values above -200.4).

<p>
The length of the <em>base_period</em> is by default the number of input 
maps. If the user wants a base period of one year and the <em>input</em> 
or <em>file</em> options (note that they are mutually exclusive) provides 
a list of maps covering one year, then there is no need to set the base 
period. Besides, if the input maps are equidistant in time, e.g. every 
8 days, there is no need to set <em>time_steps</em>. However, if the 
interval is not constant (i.e. masp are not equidistant), the user needs 
to assign time steps. These must always increase (i.e. each time step 
must be larger than the previous one) and the total number of time steps 
must be equal to the number of input maps. 

<p>
Optionally, low and/or high outliers can be removed by means of the 
<em>-l</em> and <em>-h</em> flags, respectively. In this case, the 
parameter <b>fet</b> (fit error tolerance) must be provided. The 
value of fet is relative to the value range of the variable being 
considered. For further details on the usage of the option fet, see  
Roerink et al. (2000).

<p>
The maximum number of raster maps that can be processed is given by the 
user-specific limit of the operating system. For example, the soft limits 
for users are typically 1024. The soft limit can be changed with e.g. 
<tt>ulimit -n 4096</tt> (UNIX-based operating systems) but it cannot be 
higher than the hard limit. If the latter is too low, you can as superuser
add an entry in:

<div class="code"><pre>
/etc/security/limits.conf
# &lt;domain&gt;      &lt;type&gt;  &lt;item&gt;         &lt;value&gt;
your_username  hard    nofile          4096
</pre></div>

This will raise the hard limit to 4096 files. Also have a look at the 
overall limit of the operating system
<div class="code"><pre>
cat /proc/sys/fs/file-max
</pre></div>
which on modern Linux systems is several 100,000 files.

<p>
Use the <b>-z</b> flag to analyze large amounts of raster maps without
hitting open files limit and the <em>file</em> option to avoid hitting
the size limit of command line arguments.
Note that the computation using the <em>file</em> option is slower than
with the <em>input</em> option.
For every single row in the output map(s) all input maps are opened and
closed. The amount of RAM will rise linearly with the number of 
specified input maps. The <em>input</em> and <em>file</em> options are
mutually exclusive: the former is a comma separated list of raster map
names and the latter is a text file with a new line separated list of
raster map names. Note that the order of maps in one option or 
the other is very important.

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

<h3>Average temperature data example</h3>
This small example is based on a climatic dataset for North Carolina which
was from publicly available data (monthly temperature averages and monthly
precipitation sums from 2000 to 2012, downloadable as
<a href="http://courses.ncsu.edu/mea592/common/media/02/nc_climate_spm_2000_2012.zip">GRASS GIS 7 location</a>):


<div class="code"><pre>
# set computational region to one of the maps
g.region raster=2004_03_tempmean -p
</pre></div>

Visualize the time series as animation:
<div class="code"><pre>
# note: color table is different from standard "celsius"
g.gui.animation rast=`g.list type=raster pattern="*tempmean" sep=comma`
</pre></div>

<p>
Since HANTS is CPU intensive, we test for now at lower resolution:
<div class="code"><pre>
g.region -p res=5000

# HANTS: Harmonic analysis of the 156 input maps...
# just wildly guessing the parameters for a test run:

# generate and check list of input maps (the order matters!)
g.list type=raster pattern="20??_??_tempmean" output=tempmean.csv

r.hants file=tempmean.csv nf=6 dod=5 delta=0.1 base_period=12

# assign reasonable color tables for temperature
for map in `g.list type=raster pattern="*tempmean_hants"` ; do
    r.colors $map color=celsius
done

# assign degree Celsius color table
r.colors 2000_06_tempmean_hants color=celsius

# verify with one of the 156 results (still at reduced resolution):
r.mapcalc "2000_06_tempmean_diff = 2000_06_tempmean - 2000_06_tempmean_hants"

r.colors 2000_06_tempmean_diff color=differences

# see HANTS time series as animation
g.gui.animation rast=`g.list type=raster pattern="*tempmean_hants" sep=comma`


# Check HANTS behaviour in a given point 
east=740830

for map in `g.list rast pat="20??_??_tempmean"` ; do   
  r.what map=$map coordinates=$east,$north >> time_series_orig.csv
done

for map in `g.list rast pat="*tempmean_hants"` ; do 
  r.what map=$map coordinates=$east,$north >> time_series_hants.csv 
done

# merge files:
echo "east|north|temp_orig|temp_hants" > time_series_final.csv

paste -d'|' time_series_orig.csv time_series_hants.csv | \
      cut -d'|' -f1,2,4,8 >> time_series_final.csv

<h3>Using t.* modules to check for basic statistics</h3>

The temporal framework (t.* modules) can be used to assess basic statistics:

<div class="code"><pre>
# create spatio temporal data set with hants output maps
t.create type=strds temporaltype=absolute  output=tempmean_hants \
  title="Mean Temperature HANTS" description="Mean Temperature reconstructed with HANTS"

# register maps in the strds
t.register -i type=raster input=tempmean_hants \
  maps=`g.list raster pattern=*tempmean_hants sep=,` start="2000-01-01" \
  increment="1 months"

# getting general info of the strds (including max and min of the whole series)
t.info type=strds input=tempmean_hants

# getting statistics for each map in the series
t.rast.univar -h tempmean_hants > stats_hants.txt
</pre></div>
