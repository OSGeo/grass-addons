<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.centerline</em> creates a new map with a line representing an 
approximation of the central tendency of a series of input lines that
all have similar trajectories. This can for example, be the central 
line of a river represented by its two sides, or a line representing 
the general direction of a series of flight paths, etc.

<p>
Two algorithms are proposed in the module, both based on the idea of 
using a reference line, creating a series of reference points along 
this line and then finding the coordinates of corresponding points on 
all the input lines. The default algorithm uses closest distance to 
identify corresponding points, while the second algorithm (<b>t</b> 
flag) draws perpendicular transversals at the reference points and uses 
the intersections of these transversals with the other lines as 
corresponding points.

<p>
In detail, the default algorithm goes as follows: 
<ul>
	<li>choose one of the input lines as reference line</li>
	<li>create a series of points at regular intervals on this line</li>
	<li>for each of these points:
	  <ul>
		  <li>find the closest point on each of the input lines</li>
		  <li>get the coordinates of those points</li>
		  <li>calculate the mean or (mathematical) median of these coordinates</li>
	  </ul>
	</li>
	<li>use the calculated means (or medians) as vertices of the new line</li>
</ul>

<p>
The transversals algorithm goes as follows: 
<ul>
	<li>choose one of the input lines as reference line</li>
	<li>create a series of perpendicular (transversal) lines at regular intervals on this line</li>
	<li>for each of these transversals:
	  <ul>
		  <li>find the intersection points of the transversal with all input lines</li>
		  <li>get the coordinates of those points</li>
		  <li>calculate the mean or (mathematical) median of these coordinates</li>
	  </ul>
	</li>
	<li>use the calculated means (or medians) as vertices of the new line</li>
</ul>

<p>The user can change three parameters in the algorithms: the choice 
of the reference line (<b>refline</b>), the number of vertices to 
calculate (<b>vertices</b>) and the search range (<b>range</b>), i.e. 
for the default algorithm the maximum distance of corresponding points 
from the reference line and for the second algorithm the length of the 
transversals on each side of the reference line.

<p>If no reference line is given the module choses the reference line 
by determining the mean distance of the midpoint of each line to the 
midpoints of all other lines. The line with the lowest mean distance is 
then chosen as the reference line. If no range is given, the module 
uses the mean of the above mean distances as the range for the 
transversals algorithm, and an unlimited search range for the default 
algorithm.

<p>If the <b>m</b> flag is set and there are more than 2 lines in the 
input file, the module calculates the mathematical median of the x and 
of the y coordinates.
	
<h2>NOTES</h2>

This module is more of a proof of concept showing that an approximate 
solution to the problem is possible with existing GRASS modules. A 
C-based solution would probably be much more efficient.

<p>The median in this module is <b>not</b> the geometric median, but 
the simple mathematical median respectively of the x and the y 
coordinates.

<p>The transversals algorithm is very sensitive to the range parameter. 
The user might want to play around with this parameter to find the best 
value.

<p>Increasing the number of vertices should have a smoothing effect on 
the resulting line, but in the case of the transversals algorithm it 
can possibly lead to more instability.

v.centerline input=flightpaths output=center_line_mean_5000 range=5000
v.centerline -t input=flightpaths output=center_line_mean_t
v.centerline -t input=flightpaths output=center_line_mean_t_8000 range=8000
