<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.civil.road</em> generate a topography edge for design roads, channels 
and ports.
<p>
Applications:

<ul>
	<li>Roads, streets, railroads, walls,...</li>
	<li>Channels, reservoirs, supply and waste water conduction,  ...</li>
	<li>Ports, </li>
</ul>

<h2>USAGE</h2>

For run the program, a map with one polyline (horizontal polygon or edge), is 
required. If a table in layer 1 exist, this will no be overwrite, this layer is
free for store information about the edge by the user.


<p>
There are three options for run the program, Create/Update edge, Update
solution and Insert point in edge layer.


<p>
The <em>-n</em> flag (Create/Update new edge), will convert the polyline 
in a edge, i.e., four tables will be add to the polyline layers map, attached 
to points in its respective layers, where the parameter of the road will be 
stored . This flag must be selected for create a edge from a polyline or if 
the vertices of the edge are moved or added another ones.

<p>
The <em>-u</em> flag "Update solution" will write the selected maps, 
with its additional parameters for some of them, and with the parameters 
included in the tables of the edge.

<p>
The name of the outs maps, by default are selected. If the out name map is
preceded with character "_", this name will be added to the edge name map.
This is useful for change of edges quickly.

<p>
The <em>-i</em> flag (Insert points), new points for defining the road, 
can be added to the layers _Vertical, _Section and _Trans, referencing by pk.

<p>
The user must select the layer and give a list with the pks. The options 
of the fist pk where the new will be inserted, will be copied in the new.

<p>
The other options are described below.

<h2>Tables</h2>

<p>
Geometric roadway design can be broken into four main parts: horizontal 
alignment, profile (vertical alignment), platforms definition and cross-section. 

There are maps in horizontal 
alignment for display in plan, maps in vertical alignment that requires a 
new display for visualization in profile view, and maps in cross-section that 
requires a new display for visualization in profile cross-section view.

<p>
The tables stored in the edge map are:

<h3>Layer 1:</h3>
<p>
Created with only cat column (if not exist), is for free use to add columns with information 
of the edge.



<h3>Layer 2:</h3> 
<p>
<b>"NameEdge"_Horizontal</b>, for insert the parameters of the horizontal 
alignment. This layer have points in all vertices of the horizontal polygon. 
No more points can be added to this layer.

<p>
The columns for editing by the user are:

	<ul>
		<li><b>radio</b>: radio of curve

			<p>- for anticlockwise</p>
		</li>
		<li><b>a_in</b>: Parameter A of input Clothoid</li>
		<li><b>a_out</b>: Parameter A of output Clothoid</li>
		<li><b>widening</b>: Widening of curve (where this widening is growing 
		in the clothoid, only in mode exact)</li>
	</ul>
					
		
					
<h3>Layer 3:</h3> 
<p>
<b>"NameEdge"_Vertical</b>, for insert the parameters of the vertical 
alignment.This layer are created with the first an last vertices of the 
horizontal polygon. New point can be added by the flag i (Insert point), 
or with edit gui. The added points, are inserted in the edge referencing by pk.

<p>
The columns for editing by the user are:

	<ul>
		<li><b>pk</b>: kilometric point of the edge</li>

		curve (no yet implemented)</li>
	</ul>
					

	
		
<h3>Layer 4: </h3>

<b>"NameEdge"_Section</b>, for insert the parameters of the platform. 
This layer are created with the first an last vertices of the horizontal 
polygon. New point can be added by the flag i (Insert point), or with edit 
gui. The added points, are inserted in the edge referencing by pk.
<p>
The columns for editing by the user are:

	<ul>
		<li><b>pk</b>: kilometric point of the edge</li> 
		<li><b>sec_left, sec_right</b>: For defining left and right platform 
		lines (distance and height to the edge), separated by ";" </li>
		<li><b>type_left, type_right</b>: Types of left and right lines

		separated by ";"
			<b>l</b>: linear approximation between definition points.

	</ul>
<p>					
Between two points, if the second input distance equal zero, the line will be 
stopped. If the second input distance equal -1, this point will not be processed
and the next one will be considered.


					
<h3>Layer 5:</h3> 
<p>
<b>"NameEdge"_Tran</b>s, for insert the parameters of transects to the edge. This layer 
are created with the first an last vertices of the horizontal polygon. New point can be added by the flag
i (Insert point), or with edit gui. The added points, are inserted in the edge referencing by pk
