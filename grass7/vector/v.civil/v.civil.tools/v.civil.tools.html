<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.civil.tools</em> tools for generate edges, roundabout and street platforms.

<h3>Align</h3> 

<p>
Generates an alignment from a start point. This point can be defined as a point on a curve, then radio, center and 
a point of the curve (first point of alignment) must be given. Or the point can be defined as a point of straight, 
then the radio will be 0, the center of the curve now is the fist point of the straight and the point of the curve is 
the second point of the straight (first point of alignment).

<p>
In both cases, the parameter of the clothoid must be given. This clothoid ends in the curve 2.

<p>
The curve 2 can be a list of curves and straights. It is defined by radio, the same input clothoid above 
(with the sign changed in some cases), longitude of the curve, and the parameter of out clothoid.

<p>
To close the alignment or connect to another curve with different clockwise, a straight must be defined as curve 2, with
radio, clothoid in and out equal to 0, and with a required longitude.

<p>
This option call v.civil.road to create the edge and plan alignment. Example:

<h3>Round</h3> 

<p>
Generates an alignment of a roundabout with mayor and minus radio, azimut, and the center of it.

<p>
This option call v.civil.road to create the edge and plan alignment with the name given in the required section.



<h3>Street1</h3> 
<p>
This section give the parameters to get a curve between the platforms lines of two edges. 

<p>
The first parameter is the radio for the two platforms lines.

<p>
The rest of the parameters of the two edges can be obtained with their respective plan maps.

<p>
The output is an auxiliary map with lines representing the center of curve and initial and final pks of curve.


<h3>Street2</h3>
<p>
This section give the parameters to get a curve between the platforms lines of a edge and the platforms lines of an roundabout. 

<p>
The first parameter is the direction of the edge, if the edge go into or go out from the roundabout.

<p>
Second parameter is the radio for the two platforms lines.

<p>
The rest of the parameters of the two edges can be obtained with their respective plan maps.

<p>
The output is an auxiliary map with lines representing the center of curve and initial and final pks of curve.
