<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<b>v.perc1<b>.<p> Finds cluster membership of vector points in a vector map using a distance threshold
<b>maxthresh<b>. The units used for this maxthresh are the same as those set in the current map environemnt.
Various .csv outputs can be chosen, from standard output <b>output<b> at the end of computation,
inteerval output <b>interval<b> or complete output <b>a<b> for every vector point pair relationship
assessed.

<p>
vector point pair relationships are assessed by the distance between them. If this distance between
the two points is smaller than the inputted maxthresh then they a grouped and assigned the same 
group membership attribute number.



<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

<h3>Print standard output</h3>

<p>
v.perc1 input=archsites output=archsitesperc maxthresh=2000 

<h4>Print interval ouput</h4>

v.perc1 input=archsites output=archsitesperc maxthresh=2000 interval=10

<h4>Print total ouput</h4>

v.perc1 input=archsites output=archsitesperc maxthresh=2000 -a
