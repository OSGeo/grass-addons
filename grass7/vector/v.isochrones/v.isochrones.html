<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.isochrones</em> creates a vector polygon map of isochrones 
(<b>isochrones</b>) based on a roads map (<b>map</b>) with speed 
or cost attribute (<b>cost_column</b>), one or several starting points 
(<b>start_points</b>) and time steps (in minutes) for the isochrones 
(<b>time_steps</b>). The module is actually a front-end to different 
GRASS GIS modules, and the user can chose the approach with the <b>method</b> option
(see the notes section for details).

<p>
The spatial precision of the analysis is defined by the current computational 
region. The user can define this with 
<em><a href="g.region.html">g.region</a></em>. 
Care should be taken to not define a too high resolution for the spatial extent
covered. Otherwise the user might be confronted with memory issues.


<h2>NOTES</h2>

Two approaches are currently implemented in the module:

<p>
The first (default) approach is based on <em><a href="v.net.iso">v.net.iso</a></em>. The output 
of that module is then used to assign isochrone values to all pixels based on the nearest
road segment that is within a given distance (<b>max_distance</b>). The <b>-i</b> flag allows
to calculate a separate isochrone map for each starting point.
For this approach, the input road map currently has to be prepared by adding all nodes (using 
<em><a href="v.net">v.net</a></em> with 'operation=nodes' and the '-c' flag. 
For each starting point, the algorithm then finds the closest node on the network 
and calculates the isochrones from there. This allows to use the same network for 
many analyses without having to go through the time of adding the starting points 
at each run. In addition, a <b>cost_column</b> has to be present in the attribute table containing for each line segment 
the time of traversal in minutes (i.e. length/speed).

<p>
The second approach is based on <em><a href="r.cost.html">r.cost</a></em>. 
It transforms the roads to raster (here <b>cost_column</b> has to point to an attribute
column containing speed in km/h), assigning a user chosen <b>offroad_speed</b> to all offroad
pixels, calculates time cost from the starting points and then transforms the result into 
discrete vector polygons based on the time steps chosen. Optionally, the user can chose to 
keep the a raster output of <em><a href="r.cost.html">r.cost</a></em> (<b>timemap</b>).
Current region settings are used to define the maximal extension and the resolution 
at which the cost map is calculated. The <b>memory</b> option allows to decide how much
memory the <em><a href="r.cost.html">r.cost</a></em> module can use (see the r.cost man page
for more details). One big advantage of the this second approach is that the road network
does not have to be topologically clean in order to get meaningful results.
