<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>g.md5sum</em> is a utility script that creates a checksum hash for
a given raster, vector, raster3d map, or a database which is connected
to a vector map.
<p>
This module is intended to be used as part of the <i>GRASS Test Suite</i>
to ensure that code changes do not alter module output unexpectedly.


<h2>NOTES</h2>

The operation is performed by exporting the map with the appropriate
<em>*.out.ascii</em> module and piping the result into the <tt>md5sum</tt>
program, which must be installed. Databases connected to vector maps
also have their table column defintion included as part of the hash.


<h2>TODO</h2>

Add a layer= option for type=database?<br>
More detained description of database columns.
 (does that matter as long as the stored data is the same? e.g. do we care if the DB backend is different?)
