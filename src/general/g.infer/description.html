<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<b>g.infer</b> is a tool to create rule-based data-driven workflows 
from GRASS data layers and additional data sources.
<b>g.infer</b> can modify existing GRASS data layers, can create new 
vector layers or can start additional additional GRASS modules. This 
is controlled by an inference process, which applies a knowledge 
base on a set of known facts (data). <em>g.infer</em> provides a
<b>Production System</b> to set up <b>Expert Systems</b> from domain 
knowledge and GIS data layers. <p>

<p>
The <em>g.infer</em> inference environment is based on a strict 
separation of knowledge (rules) and data (facts and  object 
instances). Data consists of GRASS-derived spatial information and 
other input. The <em>g.infer</em> inference engine applies the 
knowledge, consisting of rules (stored in the rulebase), to the 
available data. For development and testing, interactive access and 
logging options are available.
<p>
<em>g.infer</em> provides a flexible environment to start rule-based 
work. For complex tasks there are also advanced capabilities to 
extend the knowledge modelling whenever necessary. This approach can 
be used for geodata classification, GIS workflow control and other 
tasks.

<p>
The <b>C-Language Integrated Production System (CLIPS) Expert System 
Shell</b> environment is embedded within <em>g.infer</em> using the 
<b>pyCLIPS</b> Python module. In depth information is found in the 
References, which contain also links to literature describing the 
projects <b>Jess</b> and <b>Drools</b> which are based on CLIPS. 
Their documentation contains additional clues for CLIPS-related 
development.
<p>
The exchange of data between the GRASS and CLIPS environments is 
handled by extensions of the pyCLIPS functionality, connecting both 
GRASS and CLIPS. See the "Notes on g.infer pyCLIPS 
extensions" section for details. <p>


<h3>Input</h3>

<em>g.infer</em> can ingest multiple input sources as data: Spatial 
information can be imported from GRASS data layers (raster, rast3d, 
point-vector) and additional sources. Rule base-related constructs 
(templates, facts, classes and instances) are read from external 
files or built-in rule bases via the library option.
<p>
Additional data can also be imported during the inference process if 
requested by the rule base. The user can further enter facts and 
rulebase elements via an interactive CLIPS prompt.

<h3>Output</h3>

<em>g.infer</em> can manipulate the content of imported GRASS data 
layers and other sources of data. These changes can be written back 
to the respective GRASS layers using the <b>export</b> option for 
persistent storage. A new vector layer can be created through the
<b>output</b> option. The creation of additional GRASS layers can be 
invoked by the rulebase beyond the limited range of options provided 
by <em>g.infer</em> module parameters.


<h3>Rulebase</h3>

The <em>g.infer</em> rulebases contains the working knowledge for 
the inference process, which is seperate from the data (facts). They 
are read from file by the <b>rulebase</b> option or selected using 
the <b>library</b> option. Rulebases can be edited via the 
interactive CLIPS prompt (-i flag) before the actual inference run. 
<p>
There are three ways  to represent knowledge in g.infer. They are 
based on concepts from the CLIPS programming language (see CLIPS 
documentation for details). All of them can be part of the rulebase:

<ul>
<li><b>Rules</b>, for heuristic knowledge based on experience. Rules 
can be applied to facts and objects.
<p>
<li><b>Functional Programming</b>, where functions defined as code 
returning values based on the provided input.
<p>
<li><b>Object-oriented programming</b>, supporting  features such as 
classes, message-handlers, abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance 
and polymorphism.
</ul>
<p>
Rules adhere to a IF THEN layout defined by the CLIPS programming 
language (see below). The condition antecedent ("IF") -part is 
referred to as left hand side (<b>LHS</b>), while the invoked 
consequent ("THEN") is  called the right hand side (<b>RHS</b>). LHS 
and RHS sides of a rule statement are connected by the "<b>=></b>" 
characters.
<p>


<h3>Inference Engine</h3>

The inference engine is the part of the <em>g.infer</em> module 
which evaluates what rules are to be applied, based on the currently 
available data (facts).

The CLIPS inference engine used in <em>g.infer</em> is based on the 
Rete algorithm (Forgy 1982), using a forward-chaining data-driven 
approach. The order in which rules are to be executed can be 
controlled in three ways: By explicitly defining <b>salience</b> 
values for each rule, knowledge base partitioning by <b>modules</b> 
or implicitly by setting the <b>conflict resolution</b> strategy
(<b>strategy</b> option). The section "Rulbase Development, Operation 
and Debugging" holds a more detailed description.

<h3>Performance</h3>

The Rete-algorithm performs well for a change  below 10 percent of 
the available data (facts) during an inference run. Scenarios, in 
which the complete content of a GRASS layer must be changed, 
resulting in 100 percent change, will result in decreased performance.
<p>
<em>g.infer</em> uses the current settings of the GRASS region to 
create facts from the GIS layers which are provided as input. The 
resolution of the region must be set appropriately for the task, as 
a very high resolution will result in a large number of facts.

<h3>Knowledge Engineering in g.infer</h3>

Knowledge engineering (modelling) in <em>g.infer</em> involves in 
most cases the definition of  rules for the rulebase. It can also 
include more complex programming tasks, such as conditions, loops, 
functions and object oriented programming.

For knowledge modelling and programming in <em>g.infer</em>, the 
programming language of the CLIPS Expert System Toolkit is used, 
which is closely related to the programming language <b>LISP</b>. 
For an in depth description of the CLIPS language, refer to the 
CLIPS Users's Guide and Reference Manuals (Giarratano 2007, 2008).
A useful introduction to LISP is provided by Graham, 1995.
<p>

In the following, the given <i>examples</i> refer to a rulebase and 
are imported via a rulebase file, from a built in demo rulebase, or 
are entered using the interactive CLIPS prompt. This CLIPS-based
<b>programming</b> can not be mixed with GRASS GIS scripting, but can 
invoke GRASS modules as part of the RHS of rules.

<h4>Rulebase Notation</h4>

<em>g.infer</em> rulebase constructs use a fully parenthesized polish 
prefix notation: Any term, or formula, must be put in braces, with 
the operator preceding the operands:

<div class = "code"><pre>
(operator operand1 operand2 ... operandN)
</pre></div>
<p>
This differs from the infix notation commonly used in GRASS GIS, like in
<em>r.mapcalc</em>:
<p>

<ul>
<li><pre><b>Infix (GRASS GIS)</b>: ((1 + 2) + 3 )  Result: 6</pre>
<li><pre><b>Prefix (CLIPS)</b>:    (+ (+ 1 2) 3 )  Result: 6</pre>
</ul>
<p>

<h4>Data Types</h4>

<em>g.infer</em>'s rule engine provides eight primitive data types 
for representing information. As the programming language of the 
CLIPS Production System is weakly typed, variables can be declared 
without explicitly setting a type. The available types are 
<ul>
<li><b>float, integer, symbol, string, external-address, 
fact-address, instance-name</b> and <b>instance-address</b>.</li>
<li><b>Numeric information</b> can be represented using floats and 
integers.</li>
<li><b>Symbolic information</b> can be represented using symbols and 
strings.</li>
</ul>
A number consists only of digits (0-9), a decimal point (.), a sign 
(+ or -), and, optionally, an (e) for exponential notation with its 
corresponding sign. A number is either stored as a float or an 
integer. Any number consisting of an optional sign followed by only 
digits is stored as an integer. All other numbers are stored as 
floats.

<h4>Facts</h4>

Facts are the common high level form for representing information in 
g.infer. Within the CLIPS Production System, facts are the 
fundamental unit of data to be processed by the rulebase to infer 
information by the firing of applicable rules. Each fact represents 
a piece of data which has been placed in the overall <b>fact list</b>
of the currently known facts.

<p>
Facts may be added to the fact list (using the <b>assert</b> 
command), removed from the fact list (using the <b>retract</b> 
command), modified (using the <b>modify</b> command), or duplicated 
(using the <b>duplicate</b> command) by either direct user 
interaction or while the rule base is executed. The number of facts 
in the <b>fact list</b>  and the amount of information that can be 
stored within a fact is limited only by the amount of available 
memory. If a fact is to be asserted into the fact list which exactly 
matches an already existing fact, the new assertion will be ignored. 
This default behaviour can be changed.

<p>

Some CLIPS language commands, including <b>retract, modify,</b> and 
<b>duplicate</b>, require a fact to be specified by a reference. A 
fact can be specified either by fact index or fact address: Whenever 
a fact is asserted (or modified) it is assigned a unique index 
number called its <b>fact index</b>. Fact indices start at zero and 
are incremented by one for each new or changed fact. Whenever a
<b>reset</b> or <b>clear</b> command is given, the fact indices restart 
at zero. A fact may also be specified through the use of a
<b>fact address</b>. A fact address can be obtained by capturing the
return value of commands which return fact addresses (such as assert, 
modify, and duplicate) or by binding a variable to the fact address 
of a  fact which matches a pattern on the LHS of a rule. A
<b>fact identifier</b> is a shorthand notation for printing a fact. It 
consists of the character <b>f</b>, followed by a dash, followed by 
the fact index of the fact.
<p>
There are two categories of facts, <b>ordered facts</b> and <b>
non-ordered facts</b>. Both types are applied in <em>g.infer</em> to 
represent information imported from the GRASS GIS environment.

<h5> Ordered facts </h5>

Ordered facts consist of a symbol followed by a sequence of zero or 
more fields separated by spaces and delimited by an opening 
parenthesis on the left and a closing parenthesis on the right. 
Ordered facts encode information positionally and can contain 
multiple data fields. The first field of an ordered fact specifies a 
<b>relation</b> that applied to the remaining fields in the ordered 
fact.
<p>
For example, <pre>(is-a GRASS GIS)</pre> states that GRASS is a GIS.

<p>
See the CLIPS Introduction and User Guides in the Reference Section 
for an in-depth discussion.

<p>
A simple fact can contain multiple fields for content:

<pre>(assert (trail "OtterTrail" scenic flat))</pre>

<h5> GRASS environment variables as ordered facts </h5>

Ordered facts are used to represent GRASS enironment variables into 
g.infer, including g.region parameters. These ordered facts can be 
manipulated within the CLIPS environment and be used when calling 
GRASS modules from within CLIPS. They must be exported back into 
GRASS to become permanent within the current session, which is not 
done by default. The following representations of GRASS environment 
variables as facts are generated by default:
<p>

REGION_ROWS, REGION_COLS, REGION_CELLS, REGION_NSRES, REGION_EWRES, 
REGION_N, REGION_S, REGION_E, REGION_W, 
REGION_ROWS3, REGION_COLS3, REGION_CELLS3, REGION_NSRES3, REGION_EWRES3, 
REGION_TBRES, REGION_T, REGION_B, REGION_DEPTHS, 
GISDBASE, LOCATION_NAME, MAPSET, GRASS_GUI

<h5> Non-ordered facts </h5>

Facts to contain structured information require a <b>template</b> to 
define the structure:
<p>

Template based, non ordered facts allow to structure the content of 
a fact by assessing data fields by name (and type). The
<b>deftemplate</b> construct  is used to create a named template 
(which  can then be used to access fields by name). This approach 
is used to import GRASS layers in <em>g.infer</em> to create the 
respective facts.
<p>

The deftemplate construct allows the name of a template to be 
defined along with zero or more definitions of named fields, also 
called slots. Unlike ordered facts, the slots of a deftemplate fact 
may be constrained by type, value, and numeric range. In addition, 
default values can be specified for a slot. A slot consists of an 
opening parenthesis followed by the name of the slot, zero or more 
fields, and a closing parenthesis.

<p>

Deftemplate facts are easily distinguished from ordered facts by 
their first field. If the symbol serving as the first field 
corresponds to the name of a deftemplate, then the fact is a 
deftemplate fact. Like ordered facts, deftemplate facts are enclosed 
by an opening parenthesis on the left and a closing parenthesis 
on the right.
<p>
In addition to being asserted and retracted, deftemplate facts 
can also be modified and duplicated (using the <b>modify</b> and
 <b>duplicate</b> commands). Modifying a fact changes a set of 
 specified slots within that fact. Duplicating a fact creates a 
 new fact identical to the original fact and then changes a set 
 of specified slots within the new fact. The benefit of using the
  modify and duplicate commands is that slots which do not change, 
can be left out in the statement.
<p>
Examples are provided in the built-in rule bases via the 
library-option and in the CLIPS User's Guide.


<p>

<b>Template based Facts for GRASS Layers</b>
<p>
Whenever a GRASS layer is imported by g.infer, a template is 
created according to its data structure and facts are asserted 
for the layers content.While the template for vector layers will 
differ depending on the attribute layers, raster data templates 
adhere to the following structure:
<p>
Raster: <pre>(geo_test "a comment" (x 599000.0) (y 4921800.0) 
(value 5) (attribute "something"))</pre>

Vector: <pre>SOIL EXAMPLE (field as point layer)</pre>

Rast3d: <pre>(random_slice_00009 (x 599000.0) (y 4921800.0) (z 9.0) 
(value 1.0))</pre>
<p>
<pre>"_slice_000009" has been added by <em>g.infer</em> for 
internal reference.</pre>



<h4>Rules</h4>

<p>
The primary method of representing and modifing knowledge in 
<em>g.infer</em> are rules. Any <em>g.infer</em> rulebase comprises 
of a set of rules which collectively solve a classification task, 
establish a workflow or do similar. Rules are used to represent heuristics, 
or "rules of thumb", which specify a set of actions to be performed 
for a given situation. Rules can cause actions such as the creation, 
modification or deletion of facts or the call-up of GRASS modules and scripts.
A rule is composed of an <b>antecedent</b> and a <b>consequent</b>.
The antecedent of a rule is also referred to as the <b>if portion</b> 
or the <b>left hand side (LHS)</b> of the rule.
The consequent of a rule is also referred to as the <b>then portion</b>
 or the <b>right hand side (RHS)</b> of the rule.
<p>

The <b>antecedent of a rule</b> (LHS) is a set of conditions 
(or conditional elements) which must be satisfied for the rule 
to be applicable. The conditions of a rule are satisfied based on 
the existence or non existence of specified facts in the fact list 
or specified instances of user defined classes in the instance list.
One type of condition which can be specified is a<b> pattern</b>.
Patterns consist of a set of restrictions which are used to determine 
which facts or objects satisfy the condition specified by the pattern.
<p>
The process of matching facts and objects to patterns is called 
<b>pattern matching</b>. A mechanism, called the <b>inference engine</b>,
matches patterns against the current state of the fact list and 
instance list and determines which rules are applicable during the 
inference run.
<p>

The <b>consequent of a rule</b> (RHS) is the set of actions to be 
executed when the rule is applicable. This is colloquially refefred 
to as "the rule fires". The actions of applicable rules are executed 
when the inference engine is instructed to begin execution of applicable rules. 
If more than one rule is applicable, the inference engine uses a 
<b>conflict resolution strategy</b> to determine which rule should 
fire first. The actions of the selected rule are executed (which can 
change the overall list of applicable rules). Afterwards the inference 
engine selects another rule and executes its actions. 
This process continues until no applicable rules remain.
<p>

In many ways, rules can be thought of as IF - THEN statements found 
in procedural programming languages. However, the conditions of an 
IF - THEN statement in a procedural language are only evaluated when 
the program flow of control is directly at the IF - THEN statement. 
In contrast, rules act like WHENEVER - THEN statements.
The inference engine always keeps track of rules which have their 
conditions satisfied and thus rules can immediately be executed when 
they are applicable.In this sense, rules are similar to exception 
handlers found in other programming languages.
<p>



<h4>Comments</h4>
Rulebase content and other CLIPS code can be commented by starting 
lines with a semicolon.
<p>



<h4>Variables</h4>
Variables in CLIPS are weakly typed. 
They are not restricted to a predefined data type. 
So when creating a variable, it is not required to provide typing 
information.

The <b>defglobal</b> construct allows variables to be defined which 
are global in scope throughout the CLIPS environment.
Such a global variable can be accessed anywhere in the CLIPS environment 
and retains its value independent of other constructs. 
In contrast, some constructs (such as defrule and deffunction) allow local 
variables to be defined within the definition of the construct. 
These local variables can be referred to within the construct, but have 
no meaning outside the construct.



<h4>Functions</h4>

A function in CLIPS is a piece of executable code identified by a 
specific name which returns a useful value or performs a side effect 
(such as printing a message).
<p>

The <b>defun</b> command  is used to define new functions. 
The body of a deffunction is a series of expressions similar to 
the RHS of a rule that are executed in order by the CLIPS inference 
engine when the deffunction is called. The return value of a deffunction 
is the value of the last expression evaluated within the deffunction. 
Calling a deffunction is identical to calling any other function in CLIPS.
<p>
Function Definition Example: 
<pre>(defun fahrenheit_celsius (celsius_value) (+ (* celsius_value 1.8) 32))</pre>
<p>Examples are provided in the built-in rule bases (library option) and 
in the CLIPS User's Guide and Basic Programming Guide.

<h4>Conditionals</h4>
Examples for conditions, comparing facts and variables with each other, 
are provided in the built-in rule bases (library option) and in the 
CLIPS User's Guide and Basic Programming Guide.


<h3>Rulebase Development, Operation and Debugging:</h3>

<em>g.infer</em> is a tool to set up and operate rule-based workflows 
for information classification and data processing. The workflow will be 
loaded via a 'rulebase'-file or a built in rulebase, consisting of a set 
of rules, called a knowledge base. <p> 
Rule activiation is controlled by the <em>g.infer</em> rule engine, 
based on spatial data from the GIS layers.

When a rule is activated for the first time, it is placed on the <b>agenda</b>, 
based (in order) on the following factors:
<p>
a)   Newly activated rules are placed above all rules of lower salience 
and below all rules of higher salience.
<p>
b)   Among rules of equal salience, the current conflict resolution strategy 
is used to determine the placement among the other rules of equal salience.
<p>
c)   If a rule is activated (along with several other rules) by the same 
assertion or retraction of a fact, and steps a and b are unable to specify 
an ordering, then the rule is arbitrarily (not randomly) ordered in relation 
to the other rules with which it was activated. In this respect, the order 
in which rules are defined has an arbitrary effect on conflict resolution 
(which is also dependent upon the current underlying implementation of rules). 
This arbitrary ordering for the proper execution of rules should not be 
depended on for knowledge modelling.
<p>

Once a knowledge base (in the form of rules) has been loaded into <em>g.infer</em> 
and the fact and instance lists are available, the inference engine 
is ready to execute rules:
<p>
<ul>

<li><b>a)</b>The right hand side (RHS) actions of the selected rule 
are executed. The use of the return function on the RHS of a rule may 
remove the current focus from the focus stack. The number of rules fired 
is incremented for use with the rule firing limit.

<li><b>b)</b>  As a result of step b, rules may be activated or deactivated. 
Activated rules, whose conditions are currently satisfied, 
are placed on the agenda of the module in which they are defined. 
The placement on the agenda is determined by the salience of the rule and 
the current conflict resolution strategy. Deactivated rules are removed 
from the agenda.

<li><b>c)</b> If dynamic salience is being used, 
the salience values for all rules on the agenda are reevaluated. 
Repeat the cycle beginning with step a.

<li><b>d)</b>If a previously defined rule firing limit has been reached 
or there is no current focus, then execution is halted. The top rule on 
the agenda of the module which is the current focus is selected for execution. 
If there are no rules on that agenda, then the current focus is removed 
from the focus stack and the current focus becomes the next module on 
the focus stack. If the focus stack is empty, then execution is halted, 
otherwise step a is executed again.

</ul>

<p>
Whenever a rule modifies a specific fact, the particular fact is retracted, 
that is, removed from the fact stack and a new (altered) 
fact is instantiated and added on the fact stack. <p>

A rule base can be designed to act similar to the r.mapcalc module. 
This requires a close coupled multistage design of the rule base.
<p>
It is easily possible to construct  rule sets which act like an infinity-loop, 
which never terminates. This is in the most part undesired, 
but may be an asset for monitoring activities.

<p>
<pre>Examples are provided in the built-in rule bases (library option)
 and in the CLIPS User's Guide and Basic Programming Guide.</pre>


<p>


<h4>Conflict Resolution</h4>

When more than one rule are eglible to fire, a priorization among the 
candidate rules is needed. Rules can be explicitly assigned a rank/priority 
called <b>salience</b>.
<p>
The <b>conflict resolution strategy</b> is an implicit mechanism for specifying 
the order in which rules of equal salience should be executed.
<p>
<em>g.infer</em> provides seven conflict resolution strategies. 
The default strategy is depth. The current strategy can be set by using the set 
strategy command (which will reorder the agenda based upon the new strategy):

<p>

<ul>
<li><b>Breadth Strategy (breadth)</b>: Newly activated rules are placed below 
all rules of the same salience. 
<li><b>Complexity Strategy (complexity)</b>: 
Among rules of the same salience, newly activated rules are placed above all 
activations of rules with equal or lower specificity.
<li><b>Depth (depth: default)</b>:
Newly activated rules are placed above all rules of the same salience. 
<li><b>LEX Strategy (lex)</b>: 
Among rules of the same salience, newly activated rules are placed using 
the OPS5 strategy of the same name. First the recency of the pattern entities 
that activated the rule is used to determine where to place the activation. 
Every fact and instance is marked internally with a "time tag" to indicate its 
relative recency with respect to every other fact and instance in the system. 
The pattern entities associated with each rule activation are sorted in descending 
order for determining placement. An activation with a more recent pattern 
entities is placed before activations with less recent pattern entities. 

<li><b>MEA Strategy (mea)</b>: Among rules of the same salience, 
newly activated rules are placed using the OPS5 strategy of the same name. 
First the time tag of the pattern entity associated with the first pattern 
is used to determine where to place the activation. 
An activation thats first pattern's time tag is greater than another activations 
first pattern's time tag is placed before the other activation on the agenda. 
If both activations have the same time tag associated with the first pattern, 
then the LEX strategy is used to determine placement of the activation. 
As with the CLIPS LEX strategy, negated patterns have pseudo time tags.
<li><b>Simplicity Strategy (simplicity)</b>: 
Among rules of the same salience, newly activated rules are placed above all 
activations of rules with equal or higher specificity.
<li><b>Random Strategy (random)</b>: 
Each activation is assigned a random number which is used to determine its 
placement among activations of equal salience. 
</ul>
<p>

<h5>Salience</h5>

The preferred mechanisms in <em>g.infer</em> for ordering the execution of rules 
are explicitly assigned salience values and knowledge base grouping using 
modules. Salience allows one to explicitly specify that one rule should be 
executed before another rule.
<p>
Options to apply salience values:
<ul>
<li><b>when-defined (default)</b>: salience evaluation at the time of rule 
definition
<li><b>when-activated</b>: salience evaluation at the time of rule definition 
and upon being activated
<li><b>every-cycle</b>: salience values will be calculated dynamically at 
run-time between rule firings
</ul>


<h5>Defmodules</h5>
 Modules allow one to explicitly specify that all of the rules in a particular 
 group (module) should be executed before all of the rules in a different group.
<p>
Defmodules allow a knowledge base to be partitioned. Every construct defined 
must be placed in a module. The programmer can explicitly control which 
constructs in a module are visible to other modules and which constructs 
from other modules are visible to a module. The visibility of facts and 
instances between modules can be controlled in a similar manner. 
Modules can also be used to control the flow of execution of rules.

<pre>Examples are provided in the CLIPS User's Guide and Basic Programming 
Guide.</pre>



<h4>Agenda</h4>

The <b>agenda</b> is the list of all rules which have their conditions 
satisfied (and have not yet been executed). If the knowledge base is 
partitioned into multiple modules, each module has its own agenda. 
The agenda acts similar to a stack (the top rule on the agenda is 
the first one to be executed).


<b>Focus</b>
<p>
The current focus determines which agenda the run command uses during 
execution. The reset and clear commands automatically set the current 
focus to the MAIN module.


<p>

<h4>Logging and Debugging</h4>

<p>
Several features of <em>g.infer</em> support the development and debugging 
of rule-bases:
<p>
<h4>Debugging: <em>g.infer</em> Flags for Logging, Interaction and Abort:</h4>
<ul>
<li><b>x-Flag</b>: Stop-option: 
The stop-option terminates <em>g.infer</em> following an optional invocation 
of a interactive CLIPS shell and before the automated inference run.
<li><b>i-Flag</b>: Interactive CLIPS shell: 
The launching of an CLIPS shell before the automated inference run allows to 
query interactively all aspects of the current CLIPS session. <b>Ctrl-D</b> 
exits from the interactive Shell.
<li><b>e-Flag</b>: Traceback-Mode: CLIPS error messages are forwarded to g.infer.
<li><b>d-Flag</b>: Dribble-Mode: All CLIPS entities which are listed via the
Trace-option are written down to file for follow-up analysis.
<li><b>save-instances</b>: Allows to save COOL constructs, facts, instances 
to an ASCII file
<li><b>bsave-instances</b>: Allows to save COOL constructs, facts, instances 
to a binary file.

<li><b>watch-Option</b>: Prints watch messages for CLIPS constructs. 
These are stored to file if the dribble-flag has been set.

</ul>

<h4>Classdefault-Option</h4>
<DT>classdefault<b> </b></DT>
<DD>Class default of CLIPS engine: convenience(default),conservation

<ul>
<li><b>convenience</b>: (default) In convenience mode, for the purposes 
of role inheritance, system defined class behave as concrete classes; 
for the purpose of pattern-match inheritance, system defined classes behave 
as reactive classes unless the inheriting class is abstract; and the default 
setting for the create-accessor facet of the class slots is read-write.
<li><b>conservation</b>: The role and reactivity of system-defined classes 
is unchanged for the purposes of role and pattern-match inheritance and 
the default setting for the create-accessor facet of the class slots is ?NONE.

<h4>Rulebase Libraries</h4>
<em>g.infer</em> provides several pre-configured rulebases. 
The rulebases from the library can be used alone or in combination by 
user-defined rulebases. They provide a basic interactive user interface 
to launch specific demo applications and can also be started from the 
CLIPS prompt (using the <b>(run)</b> command). All demo rulebases contain 
extensive comments to document their functionaility for the interested user. 

<ul>
<li><b>reference</b>: Multiple examples CLIPS-language related programming 
including facts, rules, templates, etc..
<li><b>spearfish</b>: Examples on the use of GRASS modules in rule based 
programming. This library requries the Spearfish ("spearfish60") location.

</ul>


<h2>Notes on <em>g.infer</em> pyCLIPS extensions</h2>



<em>g.infer</em> extends the pyCLIPS- amd CLIPS environments with several 
commands to communicate and interact the GRASS GIS:

<ul>
<li><b>ginfer_printout</b>: Extends the CLIPS printout command for 
use in g.infer:  
(defrule duck_print1 (animal-is duck) => 
(ginfer_printout t "Demo: ginfer_printout T CRLF" crlf) 
(ginfer_printout stdout "Demo: ginfer_printout STDOUT CRLF" crlf))
<li><b>ginfer_readline</b>: Extends the CLIPS readline command for g.infer: 
(defrule duck_ask1 (animal-is duck) => 
(ginfer_printout t "Demo: ginfer_read: Feedback, please:" crlf) 
(assert (ducky1 (ginfer_read t)))(ginfer_printout t " " crlf))
<li><b>grass_message</b>:  Uses the g.message module to print messages:  
(defrule verbose_python_call0 (verbose on) => 
(assert (examine sections))(python-call grass_message "GRASS_MESSAGEd: works!"))
<li><b>grass_run_command</b>:  Invokes a GRASS module from within the CLIPS shell: 
(defrule grassrun_glist (verbose on) => 
(python-call grass_run_command "g.list" "f" "type=rast,vect"))
</ul>
<p>
Examples of the invocation of GRASS modules as part of the RHS of rules 
are provided in the built in demo rule bases.

<h3>CLIPS Object Oriented Language</h3>

The CLIPS Object Oriented Language (<b>COOL</b>) includes elements of 
data abstraction and knowledge representation. It supports abstraction, 
encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism and dynamic binding. 
An overview of COOL as a whole, incorporating the elements of both 
concepts is given in the CLIPS Basic Programming Guide.

The primary difference between objects and templates (or non ordered) 
facts is the notion of inheritance. Inheritance allows the properties 
and behavior of a class to be described in terms of other classes. 
COOL supports multiple inheritance: a class may directly inherit slots 
and message-handlers from more than one class. 
Since inheritance is only useful for slots and message - handlers, 
it is often not meaningful to inherit from one of the primitive type classes, 
such as MULTIFIELD or NUMBER. This is because these classes cannot 
have slots and usually do not have message - handlers.
