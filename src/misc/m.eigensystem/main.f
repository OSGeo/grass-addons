C The input is from stdin and has the following format
C
C First line contains one positive integer N, the diminension of the matrix
C The the matrix of real values follows N reals per line each separated by 
C white space:

C Currently, the max value for N is 30
C
C The output is N sets of values. One E line and N V W lines

C  E   real  imaginary   percent-importance
C  V   real  imaginary
C  N   real  imaginary
C  W   real  imaginary

C
C where E is the eigen value (and it relative importance)
C and   V are the eigenvector for this eigenvalue.
C       N are the normalized eigenvector for this eigenvalue.
C       W are the N vector multiplied by the square root of the magnitude
C         of the eigen value (E).
