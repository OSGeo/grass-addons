<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>m.gcp.filter</em> filters GCPs using the distance between the 
computed coordinates and the actual coordinates of each GCP. The result 
of the filtering (number of points to use after filtering, number of 
points filtered out, final RMS error) is printed out.

<p>
The transformation equations are computed anew for each iteration. The 
GCP with the largest distance between the computed coordinates and the 
actual coordinates is deactivated and the next iteration is started. 
Filtering stops when the overall RMS error is below the given 
<b>threshold</b> or when the number of active GCPs is equal to the 
required minimum number of points or when the optional maximum number 
of iterations (option <b>iterations</b>) has been reached. With the 
<b>-d</b> flag, the largest GCP error is used instead of the overall 
RMS error.

<p>
<em>m.gcp.filter</em> uses by default the results of forward 
transformations (source to target) for filtering. With the <b>-b</b> 
flag, the results of backward transformations (target to source) are 
used.

<p>
The status of GCPs (active / inactive) is only updated with the <b>-u</b> 
flag. GCPs that have been filtered out will be deactivated, not deleted.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

<p>The transformations are:
<p>order=1:
<div class="code"><pre>
    e = [E0 E1][1].[1]
        [E2  0][e] [n]
   
    n = [N0 N1][1].[1]
        [N2  0][e] [n]
</pre></div>

order=2:
<div class="code"><pre>
    e = [E0 E1 E3][1 ] [1 ]
        [E2 E4  0][e ].[n ]
        [E5  0  0][e&sup2;] [n&sup2;]
   
    n = [N0 N1 N3][1 ] [1 ]
        [N2 N4  0][e ].[n ]
        [N5  0  0][e&sup2;] [n&sup2;]
</pre></div>

order=3:
<div class="code"><pre>
    e = [E0 E1 E3 E6][1 ] [1 ]
        [E2 E4 E7  0][e ].[n ]
        [E5 E8  0  0][e&sup2;] [n&sup2;]
        [E9  0  0  0][e&sup3;] [n&sup3;]
   
    n = [N0 N1 N3 N6][1 ] [1 ]
        [N2 N4 N7  0][e ].[n ]
        [N5 N8  0  0][e&sup2;] [n&sup2;]
        [N9  0  0  0][e&sup3;] [n&sup3;]
</pre></div>

["." = dot-product, (AE).N = N'EA.]
<p>In other words, order=1 and order=2 are equivalent to order=3 with
the higher coefficients equal to zero.
