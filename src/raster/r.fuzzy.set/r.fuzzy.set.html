<h2>OPTIONS</h2>
<dl>
<dt><b>input</b></dt>
<dd>Name of input raster map to be fuzzified. This map may be of any type and may
require null values.
</dd>
<dt><b>points</b></dt>
<dd>A list containing 4 (A,B,C,D) or 2 (A,B) points defining set boundaries.
Points do not have to be in map range, but this may lead to only 0 o 1 membership for
the whole map. For side parameter "both", range between A and D defines base,
but range between B and C core of the fuzzy set. Between A and B and C and D are
set's boundaries. If side is "both" it require 4 points, else 2 points.

<dt><b>side</b></dt>
<dd>Option indicates if set is fuzzified of both sides (both), left or right
side. See description for details.

<h2>OUTPUTS</h2>
<dl>
<dt><b>output</b></dt>
<dd>Map containing membership value of original map. Map is alvays of type
FCELLS and contains values from 0 (no membership) to 1 (full membership). Values
between 0 and 1 indicate partial membership</dd>
</dl>
<h2>FUZZY SET PARAMETERS</h2>
<dl>
<dt><b>boundary</b></dt>
<dd>Parameter defined the shape of the fuzzy boundary. The default and most
popular is S-shaped, linear, J-shaped and G-shaped boundaries are also
available. The same boundaries are applied to the both sides.</dd>

<dt><b>shape</b></dt>
<dd>Optional shape modifier. Range from -1 to 1. The default value is 0 and
should  not be changed in most of the time. The negative values indicate more
dilatant set, the positive values more concentrate set. See NOTES for
details.

<h3>Impact of shape parameter on shape boundary:</h3>

</dd>
<dt><b>height</b></dt>
<dd>Optional height modifier. Range from 0 to 1. The default value is 1 and
indicates full membership. If height is less than one the
maximum membership is equal to height. See image: Fuzzy set definition.</dd>

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<h4>Definition of fuzzy set</h4>
Fuzzy sets are sets whose elements have degrees of membership. Zadeh (1965)
introduced Fuzzy sets as an extension of the classical notion of sets. Classical
membership of elements in a set are binary terms: an element either belongs or
does not belong to the set. Fuzzy set theory use the gradual assessment of the
membership of elements in a set. A membership function valued in the real unit
interval [0, 1]. Classical sets, are special cases of the membership functions
of fuzzy sets, if the latter only take values 0 or 1. Classical sets are in
fuzzy set theory usually called crisp sets. Fuzzy set theory can be used in
a wide range of domains in which information is imprecise, including many
GIS operations.


<h2>NOTES</h2>
<h4>Calculation of boundary shape</h4>
Depending on type of the boundary different equation are used to determine its
shape:
<p>
<b>Linear:</b> the membership is calculated according following equation:
<pre><code>
value  <=  A -> x = 0
A < value > B -> x = (value-A)/(B-A)
B <= value >= C -> x = 1
C < value > D -> x = (D-value)/(D-C)
value >= D -> x = 0

where x: membership
</code></pre>

<p>
<b>S-shaped:</b> the membership is calculated according following equation:
<pre><code>
sin(x * Pi/2)^m (for positive shape parameter)
1-cos(x * Pi/2)^m (for negative shape parameter)

where x: membership, and
m = 2^exp(2 * |shape|)
For default shape=0, m = 2 (most common parameter for that equation).
</code></pre>

<p>
<b>G-shaped:</b> the membership is calculated according following equation:
<pre><code>
tan(x * Pi/4)^1/m

where x: membership, and
m = 2^exp(-2 * shape) (for negative shape parameter)
m = 2^(1-shape) (for positive shape parameter)
For default shape=0, m = 2 (most common parameter for that equation).
</code></pre>

<p>
<b>J shaped:</b> it use following equations:
<pre><code>
tan(x * Pi/4)^m

where x: membership, and
m = 2^exp(2 * shape) (for positive shape parameter)
m = 2^(1+shape) (for negative shape parameter)
For default shape=0, m = 2 (most common parameter for that equation).
</code></pre>
