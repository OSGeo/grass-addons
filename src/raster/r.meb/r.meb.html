<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

The Multivariate Environmental Bias (MEB) takes the medium 
conditions in an reference area <em>N</em> and computes how much conditions in 
a subset of <em>N </em> (<em>S</em>) deviate from these medium 
conditions (van Breugel et al. 2015). This can for example be used to 
see how well conditions in the protected areas of a country represent 
conditions in the whole country.

<p>
The measure is based on the Multivariate Environmental Similarity 
(<em>MES</em>) surface, which was proposed by Elith et al (2010).  The MESS 
measures the similarity in a set of variables between any given location in 
an area and the locations in a reference area.

<p>
The first step to compute the MES for a location <em>P</em> is to calculate 
how similar conditions in <em>P</em> are compared to the conditions 
in the reference area <em>N</em>, based on variable <em>V<sub>i</sub></em>. 
The similarity 
is expressed as the deviation from <em>V<sub>i</sub></em> 
 in <em>P</em> from the median of <em>V<sub>i</sub></em> in <em>N</em>. This 
is done for all variables of interest (V<sub>1</sub>, V<sub>2</sub>, 
...V<sub>j</sub>).

<p>
In the original equation proposed by Elith et al (2010) the final 
<em>MES</em> in location <em>P</em> is computed as the minimum of the 
similarity values (<em>IES<sub>minimum</sub></em>) of the individual 
variables (<em>V<sub>j</sub></em>) in <em>P</em>. However, to compute the 
<em>MEB</em> using the mean or median may be a better choice as they take 
into account the similarity along all environmnetal axes and not only the one 
that deviates most. The user therefore has the option to use the mean 
(<em>IES<sub>mean</sub></em>) or median (<em>IES<sub>median</sub></em>) of 
the <em>IES</em> instead (there is still the option to use the minimum as 
well).

<p>
The <em>MEB</em> is computed as the absolute difference of the median of the 
<em>MES</em> in the whole target area (MES<sub>N</sub>) and the 
median of the <em>MES</em> in the subset (<em>MES<sub>S</sub></em>), divided 
by the median absolute deviation (<em><a 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_absolute_deviation">MAD</a></em>) 
of the <em>MES</em> in <em>N</em>. It is also possible to compute 
the bias based on the individual variables (IEB) in which case the 
<em>IES</em> instead of the <em>MES</em> is used.

<p>
The addon creates a MES layer and a table (saved to csv file) with the median 
value of each variable in the region and in the reference area, the median 
absolute deviation (mad) and the environmental bias (eb). Optionally, this 
can be computed for the individual variables as well. The user has the option 
to have the addon compute the <em>MEB</em> based on the <em>MES
</em> computed using the minimum, average and/or median of the IES layers 
(see above)
    
<h2>NOTE</h2>

Input variables are expected to be or to represent continuous variables. 

<h2>Example</h2>

In the example below the <em>MEB</em> is computed for a map 'forestmap' which 
gives the distribution of forest (1) and other land cover types (0).
As environmental variables, the bio1, bio3 and bio9 are used. 

<div class="code"><pre>r.meb -m -n -o env=bio_1,bio_3,bio_9 ref=forestmap

Median Test_MES_mean (all region) = 47.338
Median Test_MES_mean (ref. area) = 69.798
MAD Test_MES_mean (all region) = 14.594
EB = 1.539

Median Test_MES_median (all region) = 45.712
Median Test_MES_median (ref. area) = 69.897
MAD Test_MES_median (all region) = 18.786

Median Test_MES_minimum (all region) = 20.364
Median Test_MES_minimum (ref. area) = 55.807
MAD Test_MES_minimum (all region) = 15.096
EB = 2.348

The results are written to Test.csv
