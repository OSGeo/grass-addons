<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

The Multivariate Environmental Bias (MEB) takes the medium 
conditions in an area <em>N</em> and computes how much conditions in 
a subset of <em>N </em> (<em>S</em>) deviate from these medium 
conditions (van Breugel et al. 2015). This can for example be used to 
see how well conditions in the protected areas of a country represent 
conditions in the whole country.

<p>The messure is based on the Multivariate Environmental Similarity 
(<em>MES</em>) surface, which was proposed by Elith et al (2015). To compute 
the MES first the similarity of a point <em>P</em> to the conditions 
in <em>N</em> with respect to variable <em>V</em> is computed. The 
similarity is expressed as the deviation from the median of <em>V</em> 
in <em>P</em> to those in <em>N</em>. This is done for all variables of 
interest (V<sub>1</sub>, V<sub>2</sub>, ...V<sub>j</sub>).

<p>In the original equation proposed by Elith et al (2010) the final 
<em>MES</em> of <em>P</em> is computed as the minimum of the 
similarity values (<em>IES<sub>minimum</sub></em>) of the individual 
variables (<em>V<sub>j</sub></em>) in <em>P</em>. However, to 
compute the <em>MEB</em> using the mean or median may be a better 
choice as they take into account the similarity along all 
environmnetal axes and not only the one that deviates most. The user 
therefore has the option to use the mean (<em>IES<sub>mean</sub></em>) 
or median (<em>IES<sub>median</sub></em>) of the <em>IES</em> 
instead (there is still the option to use the minimum as well).

<p>The <em>MEB</em> is computed as the absolute difference of the median 
of the <em>MES</em> in the whole target area (MES<sub>n</sub>) and the 
median of the <em>MES</em> in the subset (<em>MES<sub>s</sub></em>), 
divided by the median absolute deviation 
(<em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_absolute_deviation">MAD</a></em>
) of the <em>MES</em> in <em>N</em>. It is also possible to compute 
the bias based on the individual variables (IEB) in which case the 
<em>IES</em> instead of the <em>MES</em> is used.

<p>The addon creates a MES layer and a table (saved to csv file) 
with the median value of each variable in the region and in the 
reference area, the median absolute deviation (mad) and the 
environmental bias (eb). Optionally, this can be computed for the 
individual variables as well. The user has the option to have the 
addon compute the <em>MEB</em> based on the <em>MES
</em> computed using the minimum, average and/or median of the IES layers 
(see above)

<h2>Example</h2>
In the example below the <em>MEB</em> for a map 'forestmap' which 
gives the distribution of forest (1) and other land cover types (0).
As environmental variables, the bio1, bio3 and bio9 are used.
