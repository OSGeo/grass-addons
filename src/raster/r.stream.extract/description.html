<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.stream.extract</em> extracts streams in both raster and vector
format from a required input <em>elevation</em> map and optional input
<em>accumulation map</em>.

<h2>OPTIONS</h2>

<dl>
<dt><em>elevation</em> 
<dd>Input map, required: Elevation on which entire analysis is based.
NULL (nodata) cells are ignored, zero and negative values are valid
elevation data. Gaps in the elevation map that are located within the
area of interest must be filled beforehand, e.g. with
<em>r.fillnulls</em>, to avoid distortions.
<p>
<dt><em>accumulation</em>
<dd>Input map, optional: Accumulation values of the provided
<em>accumulation</em> map are used and not calculated from the input
<em>elevation</em> map. If <em>accumulation</em> is given,
<em>elevation</em> must be exactly the same map used to calculate
<em>accumulation</em>. If <em>accumulation</em> was calculated with
<a href="r.terraflow.html">r.terraflow</a>, the filled elevation output
of r.terraflow must be used. Further on, the current region should be 
aligned to the <em>accumulation map</em>. Flow direction is
first calculated from <em>elevation</em> and then adjusted to
<em>accumulation</em>. It is not necessary to provide <em>accumulation</em>
as the number of cells, it can also be the optionally adjusted or
weighed total contributing area in square meters or any other unit. 
When an original flow accumulation map is adjusted or weighed, the 
adjustment or weighing should not convert valid accumulation values to 
NULL (nodata) values.
<p>
<dt><em>depression</em> 
<dd>Input map, optional: All non-NULL and non-zero cells will be regarded
as real depressions. Streams will not be routed out of depressions. If an
area is marked as depression but the elevation model has no depression
at this location, streams will not stop there. If a flow accumulation map
and a map with real depressions are provided, the flow accumulation map
must match the depression map such that flow is not distributed out of 
the indicated depressions. It is recommended to use internally computed
flow accumulation if a depression map is provided.
<p>
<dt><em>threshold</em>
<dd>Required: <em>threshold</em> for stream initiation by overland flow:
the minumum (optionally modifed) flow accumulation value that will initiate
a new stream. If Montgomery's method for channel initiation is used, the
cell value of the accumulation input map is multiplied by
(tan(local slope))<sup>mexp</sup> and then compared to <em>threshold</em>.
<p>
<dt><em>d8cut</em>
<dd>Minimum amount of overland flow (accumulation) when SFD (D8) will be
used instead of MFD (FD8) to calculate flow accumulation. Only applies
if no accumulation map is provided. Setting to 0 disables MFD completely.
<p>
<dt><em>mexp</em>
<dd>Use the method of Montgomery and Foufoula-Georgiou (1993) to
initiate a stream with exponent <em>mexp</em>. The cell value of the
accumulation input map is multiplied by (tan(local slope))<sup>mexp</sup>
and then compared to <em>threshold</em>. If threshold is reached or
exceeded, a new stream is initiated. The default value 0 disables
Montgomery. Montgomery and Foufoula-Georgiou (1993) generally recommend
to use 2.0 as exponent. <em>mexp</em> values closer to 0 will produce
streams more similar to streams extracted with Montgomery disabled.
Larger <em>mexp</em> values decrease the number of streams in flat areas
and increase the number of streams in steep areas. If <em>weight</em> is
given, the weight is applied first.
<p>
<dt><em>stream_length</em>
<dd>Minimum stream length in number of cells for first-order (head/spring)
stream segments. All first-order stream segments shorter than
<em>stream_length</em> will be deleted.

<p>
<dt><em>stream_rast</em>
<dd>Output raster map with extracted streams. Cell values encode unique
ID for each stream segment.
<p>
<dt><em>stream_vect</em>
<dd>Output vector map with extracted stream segments and points. Points
are written at the start location of each stream segment and at the
outlet of a stream network. In layer 1, categories are unique IDs,
identical to the cell value of the raster output. The attribute table
for layer 1 holds information about the type of stream segment: start
segment, or intermediate segment with tributaries. Columns are cat int,
stream_type varchar(), type_code int. The encoding for type_code is 0 =
start, 1 = intermediate. In layer 2, categories are identical to
type_code in layer 1 with additional category 2 = outlet for outlet
points. Points with category 1 = intermediate in layer 2 are at the
location of confluences.
<p>
<dt><em>direction</em>
<dd>Output raster map with flow direction for all non-NULL cells in
input elevation. Flow direction is of D8 type with a range of 1 to 8.
Multiplying values with 45 gives degrees CCW from East. Flow direction
was adjusted during thinning, taking shortcuts and skipping cells that
were eliminated by the thinning procedure.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

<h4>Stream extraction</h4>
If no accumulation input map is provided, flow accumulation is
determined with a hydrological anaylsis similar to
<a href="r.watershed.html">r.watershed</a>. The algorithm is
MFD (FD8) after Holmgren 1994, as for
<a href="r.watershed.html">r.watershed</a>. The <em>threshold</em>
option determines the number of streams and detail of stream networks.
Whenever flow accumulation reaches <em>threshold</em>, a new stream is
started and traced downstream to its outlet point. As for
<a href="r.watershed.html">r.watershed</a>, flow accumulation is
calculated as the number of cells draining through a cell.

<h4>Weighed flow accumulation</h4>
Flow accumulation can be calculated first, e.g. with
<a href="r.watershed.html">r.watershed</a>, and then modified before
using it as input for <em>r.stream.extract</em>. In its general form, a
weighed accumulation map is generated by first creating a weighing map
and then multiplying the accumulation map with the weighing map using
<a href="r.mapcalc.html">r.mapcalc</a>. It is highly recommended to
evaluate the weighed flow accumulation map first, before using it as
input for <em>r.stream.extract</em>.
<p>
This allows e.g. to decrease the number of streams in dry areas and
increase the number of streams in wet areas by setting <em>weight</em>
to smaller than 1 in dry areas and larger than 1 in wet areas.
<p>
Another possibility is to restrict channel initiation to valleys
determined from terrain morphology. Valleys can be determined with
<a href="r.param.scale.html">r.param.scale</a> param=crosc
(cross-sectional or tangential curvature). Curvature values &lt; 0
indicate concave features, i.e. valleys. The size of the processing
window determines whether narrow or broad valleys will be identified
(See example below).

<h4>Defining a region of interest</h4>
The stream extraction procedure can be restricted to a certain region of 
interest, e.g. a subbasin, by setting the computational region with 
<em>g.region</em> and/or creating a MASK. Such region of interest should 
be a complete catchment area, complete in the sense that the complete 
area upstream of an outlet point is included and buffered with at least 
one cell.

<h4>Stream output</h4>
The <em>stream_rast</em> output raster and vector contains stream
segments with unique IDs. Note that these IDs are different from the IDs
assigned by <a href="r.watershed.html">r.watershed</a>. The vector
output also contains points at the location of the start of a stream
segment, at confluences and at stream network outlet locations.
<p>

<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>
This example is based on the elevation map <em>elevation.10m</em> in the
sample dataset spearfish60 and uses valleys determined with
<a href="r.param.scale.html">r.param.scale</a> to weigh an accumulation
map produced with <a href="r.watershed.html">r.watershed</a>.

<div class="code"><pre>
# set region
g.region -p rast=elevation.10m@PERMANENT

# calculate flow accumulation
r.watershed ele=elevation.10m@PERMANENT acc=elevation.10m.acc -f

# curvature to get narrow valleys
r.param.scale input="elevation.10m@PERMANENT" output="tangential_curv_5" size=5 param=crosc

# curvature to get a bit broader valleys
r.param.scale input="elevation.10m@PERMANENT" output="tangential_curv_7" size=7 param=crosc

# curvature to get broad valleys
r.param.scale input="elevation.10m@PERMANENT" output="tangential_curv_11" size=11 param=crosc

# create weight map
r.mapcalc "weight = if(tangential_curv_5 < 0, -100 * tangential_curv_5, \
                    if(tangential_curv_7 < 0, -100 * tangential_curv_7, \
		    if(tangential_curv_11 < 0, -100 * tangential_curv_11, 0.000001)))"

# weigh accumulation map
r.mapcalc "elevation.10m.acc.weighed = elevation.10m.acc * weight"

# copy color table from original accumulation map
r.colors map=elevation.10m.acc.weighed raster=elevation.10m.acc
</pre></div>

Display both the original and the weighed accumulation map.
<br>
Compare them and proceed if the weighed accumulation map makes sense.

<div class="code"><pre>
# extract streams
r.stream.extract elevation=elevation.10m@PERMANENT \
                 accumulation=elevation.10m.acc.weighed \
		 threshold=1000 \
		 stream_rast=elevation.10m.streams

# extract streams using the original accumulation map
r.stream.extract elevation=elevation.10m@PERMANENT \
                 accumulation=elevation.10m.acc \
		 threshold=1000 \
		 stream_rast=elevation.10m.streams.noweight
</pre></div>

Now display both stream maps and decide which one is more realistic.
