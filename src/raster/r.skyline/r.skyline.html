<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.skyline</em> takes a viewshed map as input and analyses the
horizon.  It has two main functions:

  <ol>
    <li> Given 2 viewshed maps containing inclination values it can
    determine whether the original viewpoint appears below, on, or
    above the horizon when viewed from each cell that falls in the
    viewshed (see below for important information about how the
    viewsheds should be calculated in order to support this function);
    <li> More generally, given any single viewshed map in which cells
    are coded either NULL (not visible from the viewpoint) or non-NULL
    (visible) it identifies cells that fall on 'near' or 'far'
    horizons (see <b>edges</b>), and determines which of those cells
    may not truly fall on the real horizon because they are on the
    edge of the computational region or fall at the maximum viewing
    distance specified when creating the original viewshed.
  </ol>
  
<p><em>r.skyline</em> can output up to 5 raster maps and 1 plain text
CSV file, as described here.

<p>The <b>skyline_index</b> map records, for each cell in the
viewshed, the difference between the inclination of the line-of-sight
from that cell back towards the viewpoint and the inclination of the
line-of-sight from the viewpoint towards the point on the horizon
opposite the cell in question.  If this skyline index is positive,
then the viewpoint would appear to be raised above the skyline,
whereas if it is negative then it would appear below the skyline.
This option requires two input viewshed maps, <b>viewshed</b>
and <b>viewshed2</b>, which must both record inclination values (the
default output from <em>r.viewshed</em> and the only ouput from the
older <em>r.los</em>).  Note that the validity of the skyline index
depends upon the user setting appropriate observer (viewpoint) and
target offsets when creating the input viewsheds - see NOTES for
important information about how to use this function.
  
<p>The <b>hoz_azimuth</b> map identifies the cells that fall on the
horizon and records the azimuth at which they appear from the
viewpoint. The horizon depicted on this map may include cells that
occur at the maximum viewing distance from the viewpoint and/or at the
edge of the current region.  Since such cells may not really represent
the point beyond which no more land is visible it may be prudent,
depending on the purpose of the analysis, to generate
a <b>hoz_type</b> map.

<p>The <b>hoz_inclination</b> map identifies the cells that fall on
the horizon and records additional data derived from the input
viewshed map.  If that map was computed with
<em><a href="r.viewshed.html">r.viewshed</a></em> then
the <b>hoz_inclination</b> map will record either the inclination
(<em>r.viewshed</em> default), simply '1' meaning that the cell was
visible (<em>r.viewshed</em> <b>-b</b> flag), or the elevation
difference between the viewpoint and horizon cell
(<em>r.viewshed</em> <b>-e</b> flag). If the input viewshed map was
computed with the older<em><a href="r.los.html">r.los</a></em> then
the <b>hoz_inclination</b> map will record the inclination at which
the horizon cells appear from the viewpoint.  Note that in all cases
the horizon depicted on this map may include cells that occur at the
maximum viewing distance from the viewpoint and/or at the edge of the
current region.  Since such cells may not really represent the point
beyond which no more land is visible it may be prudent, depending on
the purpose of the analysis, to generate a
<b>hoz_type</b> map.

<p>The <b>hoz_type</b> map records the kind of horizon represented by
each horizon cell.  This distinguishes horizon cells as follows:
  <ul>
    <li>1 = cell falls on true far horizon;
    <li>2 = cell falls at maximum viewing distance;
    <li>3 = cell falls at edge of current region.
    <li>NULL = cell does not fall on the horizon (or falls on the
    original viewpoint).
  </ul>

<p>Note that type 1 horizon cells might not really fall on the true
horizon if increasing the maximum viewing distance used when
calculating the viewshed would also increase the viewshed size.  Type
2 and 3 horizon cells might or might not fall on the true horizon -
there is no way for this module to determine that.

<p>The <b>edges</b> map records all viewshed edges, which may be of
interest when the viewshed in not contiguous (i.e. there is more than
one 'patch' of visible land).  In this case a marked cell may
represent one of the following: the point at which land becomes
visible; the point at which land becomes temporarily invisible before
becoming visible again; the point beyond which no more land is
visible.  We refer to case 2 as a 'near horizon' and case 3 as a 'far
horizon'.  The <b>hoz_azimuth</b>, <b>hoz_type</b>
and <b>hoz_inclination</b> maps, and the <b>profile</b> only record
'far horizon' cells.  The <b>edges</b> map uses the same coding scheme
as the
<b>hoz_type</b> map.

<p>The plain text CSV file <b>profile</b> records various properties
of the 'far' horizon cells.  This is sorted by increasing azimuth, so
is useful for plotting horizon profiles clockwise from North.

  
<h2>NOTES</h2>

In order to use <em>r.skyline</em> it is necessary to know the
coordinates of the viewpoint and the maximum viewing distance
specified when computing the input viewshed(s).  <b>coordinate</b>
and <b>max_dist</b> should be set to these values.

<p>It is <i>important to understand</i> that the validity of the
skyline index requires careful consideration of the observer
(viewpoint) and target offsets used to create the two input viewshed
maps.  <em>r.skyline</em> supports the use of 2 different viewshed
maps to ensure that the correct inclination values are used for the
horizon and line-of-sight back towards the 'viewpoint'. The following
example explains how these may be used.  Suppose you wish to calculate
the skyline index for all locations in the landscape from which a 3m
high building is visible, in other words whether the top of that
building appears above, on or below the horizon behind it.  There are
three steps:
<ol>
  <li>Compute the viewshed that will be used to calculate the
  inclination of the line-of-site to the horizon from the top of the
  building (<b>viewshed</b>). This would be achieved by treating the
  building as the viewpoint and setting the viewpoint offset (height
  above the ground of the viewing position) to the height of the
  building (3m) and the target offset (height above the ground of
  whatever the viewer is looking at) to zero.
  <li>Compute the viewshed that will be used to calculate the
  inclination of the line-of-sight towards the building from all
  locations from which it can be seen (<b>viewshed2</b>).  This would
  be achieved by swapping appropriate viewpoint and target offsets to
  ensure that the visibility module computes the correct
  line-of-sight, so in this case we would set the viewpoint offset to
  the height of the building (3m) and the target offset to the height
  of a person looking at the building (say 1.75m).
  <li>Finally, use <em>r.skyline</em> to compute the skyline index by
  specifying <b>viewshed</b> and <b>viewshed2</b> as the input
  viewsheds.  Be sure also to set <b>coordinate</b>
  and <b>max_dist</b> to the values that were used to generate the two
  input viewsheds.
</ol>

<p>The code does not deal with Lat/Long databases.

<p>The module only runs when the current region has integer resolution
(since the algorithm is not robust in cases where resolution is
non-integer).
