<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

This submodule - <em>r.agent.rand</em> -
is nothing but an example of how the <em>libagent</em>
library might be used to get a simple setup running.

As the name suggests, <em>r.agent.rand</em>
lets agents wander around just based on chance.
You only need to define a single input
map, just some raster map, that will be completly ignored,
it is only used to set the frame for the agents to come.
