README file for libagent's test suite

These test cases are intended to contain all the tests for
libagent and to be usable with python 2.7 and higher, it
should however run resp. via the separate unittest2 available
as backport for python 2.3-2.6 too.

To invoke e.g. the error tests only, from the topmost directory
level issue
 user@host:~/path/r.agent.aco$ unit2 discover -v -p "test*.py"

All tests except for tests.test_grassland should run without
the GRASS environment. For tests.test_grassland you must start
the tests inside the GRASS console respectively:
 GRASS 6.4.4 (foobar):~/path/r.agent.aco > unit2 discover -v -p "test*.py"
