<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>
The module <em>r.stream.distance</em> can calculate: the distance to streams; 
the distance to outlet; the relative elevation above streams; the relative 
elevation above the outlet. The distance and the elevation are calculated 
along watercourses.

<p>
The module may calculate the distance either <em>downstream</em> or 
<em>upstream</em>. The default is set on downstream. 
The upstream method calculates the distance to the local maximum or divide.
Opposite to downstream method, where every cell has one and only one downstream
cell, in upstream method every cell has usually more than one upstream cell. So
it is impossible to determine interchangeable path from any cell. 

<p>
The upstream method offers two alternative modes switched with <em>-n</em> 
flag: the <em>nearest local maximum/divide</em> is the shortest path to 
the local maximum; and the <em>farthest maximum/divide</em>
is the longest path (default option). 
In hydrological sense, the <em>nearest</em> option means the shortest path
which a particle of water must run from the divide to reach a particular pixel,
while the <em>farthest</em> option means the possible longest path.

<p>
In <em>outlets</em> mode, the module can optionally be used for subbasins.

<p>
In <em>streams</em> mode (default) it calculates the distance (downstream)
to the stream network taken in input. In <em>outlets</em> mode there are 
some additional possibilities. If the <em>subbasin</em> option is set off,
it calculates the distance only for the outlet (downstream).
If the <em>subbasin</em> option is set on, it calculates the distance to
outlet for every subbasin separately. The <em>subbasin</em> option acts 
similarly to a subbasin mask. The module <em>r.stream.basins</em> can be
used to prepare the stream network map taken in input by
<em>r.stream.distance</em>.
In fact it can be used to individuate basins and subbasins.

<p>
In lat-long locations, the module gives distances not in degrees but in meters.

<h2>OPTIONS</h2>

<dl>
<dt><b>-o</b></dt>
<dd>Outlets. Downstream method only. Calculate distance to or elevation
above the outlet instead of streams. It chooses only the last outlet in 
the network ignoring nodes.</dd>

<dt><b>-s</b></dt>
<dd>Subbasins. Downstream method only. Calculate distance to or elevation 
above stream nodes instead of streams. The distance and the elevation 
difference are relative to elementary subbasins instead of the whole basin.</dd>

<dt><b>-n</b></dt>
<dd>Near. For upstream method only. Calculate distance to or elevation 
above the nearest local maximum/divide. With the default option, the 
distance/elevation is calculated to the farthest possible maximum/divide.</dd>

<dt><b>stream_rast</b></dt>
<dd>Stream network: name of input stream network map, produced using either
<em>r.watershed</em> or <em>r.stream.extract</em>. Since stream
network maps produced by <em>r.watershed</em> and <em>r.stream.extract</em> may
slightly differ in detail, it is required to use both stream and direction maps
produced by the same module. Non-stream cell values must be set to NULL.
Alternatively, in <em>outlet</em> mode, it's the raster map of the outlet.</dd>

<dt><b>direction</b></dt>
<dd>Flow direction: name of input raster map with flow direction, 
produced using either <em>r.watershed</em> or <em>r.stream.extract</em>. 
If <em>r.stream.extract</em> output map is used, it is non-NULL only
where streams occur and NULL elsewhere. NULL (nodata) cells are ignored, 
zero and negative values are valid direction data only if they vary
from -8 to 8 (CCW from East in steps of 45 degrees). Flow direction map 
shall be of integer type (CELL). </dd>

<dt><b>elevation</b></dt>
<dd>Elevation: name of input elevation map. It can be of type CELL, FCELL or
DCELL. </dd>

<dt><b>method</b></dt>
<dd>It is possible to calculate the distance with two method: <b>downstream</b>
from any raster cell to the nearest stream cell / junction cell or outlet or
<b>upstream</b> from any cell upstream to the nearest maximum or divide.</dd>

<dt><b>difference</b></dt>
<dd>Name of output map of elevation difference to the target (outlet, node, 
stream, divide, maximum) along watercoures. The map is of DCELL type.</dd>

<dt><b>distance</b></dt>
<dd>Name of output map of distance to the target (outlet, node, stream, 
divide, maximum) along watercoures. The map is of DCELL type.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>NOTES</h2>
    
<!--
<p>
If there are more than one point or one stream network and some separate points
or separate stream networks are in catchment area defined by others it will
results as in subbasin mode. 
-->
<!--TODO: I don't understand this sentence, to be rephrased-->

<p>
In <em>stream</em> mode subbasin options is omitted. Input maps must be in 
CELL format (default output of <em>r.watershed</em>, <em>r.stream.order</em> 
and <em>r.stream.extract</em>).
The distance is calculated in meters, for flat areas not corrected by 
topography. Distance correction by topography may be done using the
following <em>r.mapcalc</em> formula:

<div class="code"><pre>
r.mapcalc expression = "dist_corrected = sqrt(distance^2 + elevation^2)"
</pre></div>

<p>
The module can work only if direction map, streams map and region have the same
settings.
This is checked by default. If resolutions differ, the module informs about 
it and stops. Region boundary and maps boundary may differ but it may lead 
to unexpected results. The elevation map is not affected by this restriction 
and can have whatever resolution.

<p>
It is also required that <em>stream_rast</em> and <em>direction</em> maps come
from the same source, e.g. both from <em>r.stream.extract</em>. If the stream
network was generated with MFD method also MFD direction map must be used.

<p>
Probably one of the most important features of <em>r.stream.distance</em> is
the ability to calculate the distance not only for streams generated by
<em>r.stream.extract</em>, but also for any integer map, as long as the
resolution corresponds to that of <em>direction</em> map. 
It can be a lake, swamp, depression and lake boundaries even divided into
smaller fragments each with its own category.

<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>

<div class="code"><pre>
    
# Set the region to match with elevation map
g.region -pa raster=elevation

# Calculate flow direction and stream network
r.watershed elevation=elevation threshold=10000 drainage=direction stream=streams

# Calculate elevation above and distance to stream network using downstream method
r.stream.distance stream_rast=streams direction=direction elevation=elevation \
  method=downstream distance=distance_stream_downstream difference=difference_stream_downstream
  
# Calculate elevation above and distance to stream network using upstream method
r.stream.distance stream_rast=streams direction=direction elevation=elevation \
  method=upstream distance=distance_stream_upstream difference=difference_stream_upstream
  
# Create outlet
echo "636645,218835" | v.in.ascii -n input=- output=outlet separator=","

# Convert outlet to raster
v.to.rast input=outlet output=outlet use=cat

# Calculate distance to and elevation above outlet
r.stream.distance -o stream_rast=outlet direction=direction elevation=elevation \
  method=downstream distance=distance2outlet difference=difference2outlet

</pre></div>
