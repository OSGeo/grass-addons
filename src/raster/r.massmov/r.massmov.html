<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>r.massmov is a numerical model that allows users to simulate the expansion (runout) and deposition of mass
movements over a complex topography by approximating the heterogeneous sliding mass to a homogeneous
one-phase fluid (following the approach proposed by Savage and Hutter (1989) and Iverson and Denlinger
(2001)). The model describes the mass movements as a two-dimensional flux taking advantage of the shallow
water equations. This formula is derived from the general Navier-Stokes equations under the hypothesis that
the vertical components of velocity and pressure are negligible with respect to the horizontal components, and
that the vertical pressure profile can be considered as almost hydrostatic (Kinnmark 1985).
</p>

<p>The required inputs can be classified in three categories based on the information type:
<ul>
<li> raster maps of the topography, in particular the sliding surface topography <em>elev</em> (digital terrain
model without the sliding body), the initial sliding mass thickness <em>h_ini</em> and the 'distance map' <em>fluiddist</em>,
representing the cells distance from the collapsing body lower limit;</li>
<li> numerical parameters for the characterization of the mass material, density <em>rho</em> [kg/m3], apparent
yield stress <em>ystress</em> [Pa], Chezy roughness coefficient <em>chezy</em> [m/s2], dynamic viscosity <em>visco</em> [Pa*s], basal friction
angle <em>bfrict</em> [deg], internal friction angle of the sliding mass during the expansion <em>ifrict</em> [deg] and the fluid rate <em>fluid</em> [m/s].This last parameter provides information on the transaction velocity of the
sliding mass when passes from a solid state to a fluid state; together with the 'distance map'
it allows to define the amount of mass mobilized as a function of time. It is worth noting that
depending on the selected rheological law different sets of parameters are mandatory;</li>
<li>control parameters to stop the simulation (like maximum time step number <em>timesteps</em> and/or
automatic stopping criterion parameters <em>stop_thres</em> and <em>step_thres</em>) and to set the number of
processors for parallel computing (<em>threads</em>). If the parallel computing is activated, and unless of different
settings, the program runs using all the available processors.

</li>
</ul>

<p>The model outputs a series of flux velocity map (<em>v</em>) and deposit depth raster map (<em>h</em>) at different time step
according to the set deltatime parameter; additionally the module outputs two raster maps representing the
maximum thickness (<em>h_max</em>) and velocity (<em>v_max</em>) registered during the simulation.
</p>

<h2>NOTES</h2>

<p>The generation of the model input maps, in case the simulation refer to en existing collapse and pre and post event DTM is available, can be performed taking advantage of the GRASS modules; in
particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>the sliding surface can be calculated by subtracting the collapsing body from the pre-event
DTM (r.mapcalc) </li>
<li>the collapsing body thickness can  evaluated by considering the negative differences between
the post and pre-event DTM multiplied for the cosine of the slope (r.mapcalc and
r.slope.aspect)</li>
<li>the distance map from the landslide toe can be obtained by applying the r.grow.distance module to the rasterized limits of the landslide</li>
</ul>

<h2>DIAGNOSTICS</h2>

<p>The module has been tested in several cases (see references), but up to now most of the simulations was done using a Voellmy rheology thus other rheology laws should be better investigated.</p>
