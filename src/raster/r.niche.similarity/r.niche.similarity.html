<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.niche.similarity</em> 

<p>A module to compute two metrics to quantify niche similarity or 
overlap between all pairs of input raster layers.

<p>One is the niche equivalency or similarity for two species 
following Warren et al. (2008) based on Schoeners D (Schoener, 
1968). This metric ranges from 0 to 1, representing respectively no 
overlap and an identical distribution. 

<p>The other is the niche overlap metric which indicates the niche 
overlap from predictions of species distributions with the I 
similarity statistic of Warren et al. (2009), which is based on 
Hellinger Distances (van der Vaart, 1998). The statistic ranges from 
0 (no overlap) to 1 (the distributions are identical). 

<p>By default the results are written to screen, but they can also 
be written to a text file with two columns for the names of each 
pair of rasters, a third column for the type of statistic (D or I) 
and a fourth column for the D or I statistic.

<h2>Notes</h2>

This implementation is especially suitable if you are working 
with very large data sets. Results were checked against the 
niche.overlap function in the phyloclim package for R, which also uses
the corrected formulation of I as published in an erratum of the 
article by Warren et al (2008).
