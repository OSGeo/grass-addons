<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

The <em>r.vif</em> module computes the variance inflation factor
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance_inflation_factor">VIF</a>)
[1] and the square root of the VIF. The VIF quantifies how much
the variance (the square of the estimate's standard deviation) of an
estimated regression coefficient is increased because of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicollinearity">multi-collinearity</a>.
The square root of VIF is a measure of how much larger
the standard error is, compared with what it would be if that
variable were uncorrelated with the other predictor variables in the
model.

<p>By default the VIF is calculated for each variable. If the user
sets a VIF threshold value (maxvif) a stepwise variable selection
procedure [2] is used whereby after computing the VIF for each
explanatory variable, the variable with the highest VIF is removed.
Next, the VIF values are computed again for the reduced set of
variables. This will be repeated till the VIF is smaller than
maxvif. This can thus be used to select a sub-set of variables for
e.g., multiple regression analysis.

<p>The user can optionally select one or more variables to be
retained in the stepwise selection. For example, let's assume the user selects
the variable <i>bio_5</i> to be retained. If in any step this
variable has the highest VIF, the variable with the next highest VIF
will be removed instead (see the examples).

<p>The user can set the 's' flag to only print the finally selected
variables to the standard output (console). Note that this only
works when the stepwise selection procedure is invoked, i.e., when
the maxvif is set. This option makes it easier to use the output of r.vif
in another function directly (see example ).

<h2>NOTES</h2>

To compute the vif all data layers are read in as a numpy array (non-data cells
are ignored). When input layers are large or many memory usage may become
problematic. In such cases the user may opt to sample raster values for random
locations and use that to compute the vif. The quantity of random locations to
be generated either can be defined as a positive integer, or as a percentage of
the raster map layer's cells (see <a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/r.random.html">r.random</a> for
details).

<p>Using random sub-set of raster cells as input means that the vif values may
vary between runs. If the sub-set is too small it may even lead to differences
in variables selected when running the step-wise procedure. Special care should
be taken when many of the equations are underdetermined (the value of vif is
shown as <i>Inf</i>).

<p>As an alternative, the user can set the <em>f</em> flag to evoke the
'low-memory option'. This will use the <a
href="r.regression.multi">r.regression.multi</a> function in the background to
compute R<sup>2</sup>, the most memory demanding part of the computation. With
this option, the addon can handle much larger data sets. The disadvantage is
that it runs much slower.

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

The following examples are based on the nc_climate_spm_2000_2012 sample data
set which you can download from
<a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/download/data/">GRASS GIS
sample data download page</a>. This data set contains monthly rainfall and
temperature data for the years 2000 - 2012. In the examples below the monthly
data of 2000 is used. The analyses are run on a smaller region, set below, to
reduce the run time.

<div class="code"><pre>g.region n=226000 s=168500 w=229500 e=298500</pre></div>

<h3>Example 1</h3>

Run VIF, setting the maximum VIF at 10. The function will print the
VIF computed at each step to the console. The same will also be
written to a text file.

<div class="code"><pre>MAPS=`g.list type=raster pattern=*2011*precip sep=,`
r.vif maps=$MAPS file=results1.csv maxvif=10
</pre></div>

Below the results are shown (here only the first and last part of the
output is shown to save space):

<div class="code"><pre>
VIF round 1
--------------------------------------
variable            vif  sqrtvif
2011_01_precip    65.03     8.06
2011_02_precip    29.10     5.39
2011_03_precip    40.20     6.34
2011_04_precip    13.12     3.62
2011_05_precip     6.81     2.61

...
...

VIF round 7
--------------------------------------
variable            vif  sqrtvif
2011_01_precip     4.25     2.06
2011_04_precip     5.22     2.29
2011_05_precip     4.86     2.20
2011_06_precip     7.13     2.67
2011_07_precip     7.58     2.75
2011_08_precip     3.32     1.82

selected variables are:
--------------------------------------
2011_01_precip, 2011_04_precip, 2011_05_precip, 2011_06_precip, 2011_07_precip, 2011_08_precip

Statistics are written to results.csv
</pre></div>

The same results are (optionally) written to a comma delimited file
(csv). It contains variables and the corresponding vif and sqrt(vif)
for each round in the stepwise variable selection. The column
'removed' gives the variable that was removed in the previous round.

<h3>Example 2</h3>

Run the same VIF analysis as above, but this time tell
the function to retain the variable 2011_02_precip. Only the last
few lines of the results are shown below. As you can see, a
different set of variables is selected, which includes the variable
'2011_02_precip'.

<div class="code"><pre>MAPS=`g.list type=raster pattern=*2011*precip sep=,`
r.vif maps=$MAPS maxvif=10 retain=2011_02_precip file=results2.csv
</pre></div>

The output is:

<div class="code"><pre>
...
...
VIF round 6
--------------------------------------
variable            vif  sqrtvif
2011_02_precip     9.29     3.05
2011_03_precip     9.02     3.00
2011_04_precip     6.30     2.51
2011_05_precip     4.99     2.23
2011_06_precip     9.72     3.12
2011_07_precip     8.36     2.89
2011_08_precip     3.30     1.82

selected variables are:
--------------------------------------
2011_02_precip, 2011_03_precip, 2011_04_precip, 2011_05_precip, 2011_06_precip,
2011_07_precip, 2011_08_precip

Statistics are written to results2.csv

</pre></div>

<h3>Example 3</h3>

Like example 1, but without writing the results to
file, and with the 's' flag set, which means only the list with
finally selected variables are printed to screen. This output can be
directl parsed in a script.

<div class="code"><pre>MAPS=`g.list type=raster pattern=*2011*precip sep=,`
r.vif -s maps=$MAPS maxvif=10

</pre></div>

The output is:

<div class="code"><pre>
2011_01_precip,2011_04_precip,2011_05_precip,2011_06_precip,2011_07_precip,
2011_08_precip
</pre></div>

This output can be captured in a variable 'SELECTION', which is used
as input in <i>i.group</i> to create a group.

<div class="code"><pre>MAPS=`g.list type=raster pattern=*2011*precip sep=,`
SELECTION=`r.vif -s maps=$MAPS maxvif=10`
i.group group=group_example input=$SELECTION

</pre></div>

This selects raster layers using the r.vif functions, and adds these
raster layers to the group 'group_example':

<div class="code"><pre>
Adding raster map <2011_01_precip@climate_1970_2012> to group
Adding raster map <2011_04_precip@climate_1970_2012> to group
Adding raster map <2011_05_precip@climate_1970_2012> to group
Adding raster map <2011_06_precip@climate_1970_2012> to group
Adding raster map <2011_07_precip@climate_1970_2012> to group
Adding raster map <2011_08_precip@climate_1970_2012> to group

</pre></div>
