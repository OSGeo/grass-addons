<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.vol.dem</em> interpolates a voxel model from a series of DEMs by
flood filling the voxel space in between.

The module is able to calculate voxel maps between at least two DEMs.
The algorithm is based on a so-called "Flood-filling" algorithm. Since
a date, label or category number of an e.g., archaeological stratum
represents always the value for the entire stratum it would be more
suitable to fill the entire 3D unit with this single value.
<p>
The input bottom and top DEMs represent each the bottom and top border
for the "voxeled" stratum, in this case the implicit structure. Before
running the <em>r.vol.dem</em> module, one needs to adjust the
three-dimensional extent of the 3D interpolation which works as an
analytical mask in the GRASS GIS module <em>g.region</em>. This
procedure adjusts additionally the voxel's size which influences the
3D resolution of the entire stratum. Furthermore, it is possible to
adjust the height and width of the voxel in order to obtain a cube or
cuboid voxel shape. In general, the smaller the voxel's size the higher
the resolution, the more precise 3D units. 

<h2>NOTES</h2>

The input data for the 3D interpolation which requires at least two
raster DEMs. They have to be entered in a certain rank, with the lowest,
according to elevation, DEM first. 
<p>
The list of label values is one for each 3D layer (labels=value): Since
one can enter an infinite number of DEMs it is possible adjust certain
labels for each 3D layer. If they are not specified, labelling starts
with layer 0. The numbers are given always upwards disregarding the
algorithm direction.
<p>
The <em>errormap</em> raster map is to represent topology errors in input
DEMs. This option does not yet create a real map but gives the coordinates
where intersections of DEMs occur.
<p>
The <em>algorithm</em> parameter is used to select the 3D flood fill
algorithm to use. The user can chose between an up or down filling
direction. The default adjustment is the upwards algorithm. The results
can become very different according to the shape and extension of the DEMs.
<p>
The <em>-c</em> flag calculates 3D cell counts for each layer: This option 
counts the number of voxels for each 3D layer label. Unfortunately, this
count is not stored in the <em>r3.info</em> information. Thus, if one
needs this information afterwards, one has to repeat the whole calculation. 
<p>
The <em>-f</em> flag fills through NULL value areas in DEMs: Null value
areas are areas which lie outside a 3D layer defined by two successive DEMs
in the input command. In the case, where a 3D layer is limited not only
from one unit surface, e.g. on top, this flag allows a further 3D
interpolation until the next DEM or the region's margin.

<p>
The <em>-h</em> flag export convex hull for polygon layers: This option
creates a 3D polygon out of the voxel model. This means, at first it will
be generated a voxel model. Afterwards, this will be converted into a
vector-file. However, the flag does not yet work properly.
-->

<p>
The <em>-g</em> flag exports voxel model as vector points: This option
creates a vector point for each interpolated voxel. This became necessary
because of the lack of suitable representation in the visualisation module
nivz in GRASS GIS 6. Nevertheless, the points can be represented virtually
as cubes in nviz which gives an idea of the voxel layer. Unfortunately,
there is still an error in the module using this flag (state 01.06.2006)
that can be corrected by the following procedure:
The module <em>r.vol.dem</em> creates a temporary txt-file in the HOME
directory. Opening this file one will find a line which starts with 
"# v.in.ascii". This line needs to be copied without the #-sign and
executed in the GRASS bash shell. 
<p>
The <em>-p</em> flag exports VTK point data instead of cell data: This
option reflects the fact that the visualisation program ParaView which
treats cell data and point data differently in comparison to the program
GRASS GIS. Hence, if one wants to visualise GRASS voxel in ParaView, this
flag is recommended. The VTK floating point precision is 1/1000 of the
current GRASS location's map unit.
<p>
The <em>-q</em> flag disables on-screen progress display:
This option does not yet work. 
<p>
The <em>-s</em> flag skips topology error checking:
The module checks the input DEMs for intersection before running the
algorithm. If such an unwanted intersection is found, the algorithm creates
an errormap (see <em>errormap</em> option) and stops the entire 3D
interpolation process. Using this flag one can skip this precaution. 
<p>
The <em>-v</em> flag generates a vtk-file for visualisation with e.g.
ParaView: Since the GRASS visualisation module nviz is unable to show
voxel as (semitransparent) cubes, the Open Source visualisation
program ParaView is now commonly used for the visualisation of GRASS GIS
maps and especially for 3D visualisations. Hence, the output GRASS GIS 
files have to be converted into a ParaView readable format.
<p>
The <em>-z</em> flag fits active region's z range to input DEMs:
This option does not yet work.
