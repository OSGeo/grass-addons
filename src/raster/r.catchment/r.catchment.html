<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.catchment</em> is a module that facilitates modeling 
"catchments" around point locations according to a walking cost 
function. The module is particularly aimed at "Site Catchment 
Analysis" for archaeology, but could be potentially useful in any 
number of applications where delimiting an area based on 
walking-costs is desirable. Although defining a catchment based on 
a threshold in walking-costs (or time) can be undertaken using <em>
r.walk</em> or <em>r.cost</em> alone, this addon module allows the 
user to enter a pre-determined square meterage (option <b>area</b>) 
for the resultant catchment, which is a different approach. This is 
useful for applications where the user wants to make a catchment of 
a particular size (e.g., certain number of square meters needed for 
farmed fields), and doesn't want to spend time via trial and error 
experimenting with different cost radii. 

<p>
Additionally, this module allows the user to enter a slope threshold 
(option <b>sigma</b>), which will mask out areas of higher slope. 
This is useful for delimiting catchments that are of generally flat 
land (e.g., areas where agriculture are likely).

<p>
Important: The user must run <b>g.region</b> first to make sure that
the region boundaries and the resolution match the input elevation map.

<h3>Options and flags:</h3>

<em>r.catchment</em> requires an input elevation map, <b>elevation
</b>, and an input vector points map of starting locations, <b>
start_points</b>. <b>area</b> is also requited, which is an integer 
value for the size of the desired catchment (in the map units of the 
defined location/region). The final required parameter is <b>map_val
</b>, which is the integer value to write to the areas defined as 
part of the catchment in the output map, <b>buffer</b>. The optional 
value, <b>sigma</b> is the slope threshold cut off value. Slopes 
above <b>sigma</b> will be masked out during the determination of 
the catchment configuration. There are two native flags for <em>
r.catchment</em>. <b>-c</b> allows you to keep the interim cost 
surface maps made. <b>-l</b> allows you to show a list of the cost 
values in that cost map, along with the size of the catchments they 
delineate. All other flags and options are inherited from 
<em>r.walk</em> (see the 
<a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/r.walk.html">r.walk</a> 
help page for more information on these).

<h2>NOTES</h2>
The module will attempt to find the cost radius that defines an area 
close to the value of <b>area</b>, but em will likely slightly 
overestimate the catchment size. The module will display the actual 
area of the defined catchment in the Command Output.

By default, <em>r.catchment</em> will create a <b>friction</b> map 
of value 0, which, when input into <em>r.walk</em> will yield a cost 
surface based on walking times only. The user may optionally create 
a <b>friction</b> map, however, and, if used, r.walk will consider 
these costs this as well when determining the cost surface used to 
determine the catchment.

The input vector points map can be manually digitized (with <em>
v.digit</em>) over topographic or cultural features, or can be 
created as a series of random points (with <em>r.random</em> or <em>
v.random</em>). 

In the case of multiple input points, the routine will attempt to 
equally divide the area (<b>area</b>) between all input points to 
determine catchments for each point. The total area of all these 
catchments will sum (close) to <b>area</b>. If two input points are 
close, their catchments may overlap. In this case, the routine will 
"meld" the two, and the melded catchment will still be of an area 
close to <b>area</b>. If truly overlapping catchments are desired, 
then the routine should be run independently for each individual 
start point.

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>
Delimit a catchment of 5,000,000 square meters around a single start 
point, ignoring areas of slope > 15 degrees:<br>

<div class="code"><pre>
r.catchment elevation=DEM10m start_points=site buffer=test_catchment 
sigma=15 area=5000000 map_val=1
</pre></div>
