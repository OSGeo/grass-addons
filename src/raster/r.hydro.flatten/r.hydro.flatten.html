<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
The tool derives single elevation value for water bodies
based on lidar data. These values are used for hydro-flattening a digital elevation model.
The <b>input</b> raster is expected to represent ground surface created by binning lidar data
(e.g., using <em><a href="r.in.pdal.html">r.in.pdal</a></em>) with averaged ground elevation.
Small gaps in the input are expected. Large gaps are interpreted as water bodies.
The minimum size of a water body can be set with <b>min_size</b> option in map units.

<p>
The output <b>water_elevation</b> is a raster map of water bodies where each water body
has a single value representing the water level elevation derived from the lidar data
at the edge of a water body.
Since the elevation varies along the edge, option <b>percentile</b> is used to determine
a single value. The variation along the edge can be examined with the <b>water_elevation_stddev</b>
output representing the standard deviation of the lidar elevation values
along the water body's edge. Higher deviation suggests problematic areas
that need to be further inspected.

<p>
To keep the intermediate results for inspection, use flag <b>-k</b>.

<h2>NOTES</h2>
While this tool was designed for water bodies, it can be used for other purposes,
e.g., for filling a gap in digital elevation models caused by excluding buildings.
<p>
This tool does not interpolate gaps in data, rather it derives a single value
for each gap. The result can be used to fill gaps and the tool can be run on large areas.
For actual gap interpolation, which is typically more computationally intensive,
see <em><a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/r.fillnuls.html">r.fillnulls</a></em>.

<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>
We will download a lidar tile with <em><a href="r.in.usgs.html">r.in.usgs</a></em> addon,
use <em><a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/r.in.pdal.html">r.in.pdal</a></em>
to bin the elevation points at 1 meter resolution, and derive elevation levels for lakes
with minimum size of 4000 m^2.
