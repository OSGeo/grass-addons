<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.seasons</em> counts the number of seasons in a time series. A 
season is defined as a time period of at least <em>min_length</em> 
length in which values are above the threshold set. If the <em>-l</em> 
flag is used, a season will be a time period in which values are below 
the threshold set. As threshold, either a fixed value for the whole 
region can be specified with the <em>threshold_value</em> option, or a 
raster map with per-cell threshold values can be supplied with the 
<em>threshold_map</em> option.

<p>
The <em>nout</em> output map holds the number of detected seasons. Output 
raster maps with the start and end dates of each season are produced 
for at most <em>n</em> number of seasons.

<p>
A season is a period of time that might include gaps up to <em>max_gap</em>. 
For each season identified, two start dates and two end dates are determined. 
The start date "start1" and the end date "end1" indicate the start and 
end of the core season, while the start date "start2" and the end date 
"end2" indicate the start and end of the full season including some 
periods shorter than <em>min_length</em> separated by gaps shorter than 
<em>max_gap</em> at the beginning and end of the season. A 
<b>core season</b> is at least <em>min_length</em> long and might 
contain gaps shorter than the <em>max_gap</em> inbetween, but not at the 
beginning or end. A <b>full season</b>, on the other hand, can have 
blocks shorter than <em>min_length</em> at the beginning or end as long 
as these blocks are separated by gaps shorter than the <em>max_gap</em>. 
Let's consider an example to visualize core and full seasons. We have 
a certain time series in which 0 means below the threshold and 1 means 
that the value is above the threshold set:
<div class="code"><pre>
000101111010111101000
</pre></div>	
If <em>min_length=4</em> and <em>max_gap=2</em>, core and full seasons 
will be identified as follows: 
<div class="code"><pre>
# core season: 
000001111111111100000
#full season
000111111111111111000
</pre></div>

<p>
The length of the longest core and full seasons can be stored in the 
<em>max_length_core</em> and <em>max_length_full</em> output maps.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

The maximum number of raster maps that can be processed is given by the 
per-user limit of the operating system. For example, the soft limits 
for users are typically 1024. The soft limit can be changed with e.g. 
<tt>ulimit -n 4096</tt> (UNIX-based operating systems) but not higher 
than the hard limit. If it is too low, you can as superuser add an 
entry in

<div class="code"><pre>
/etc/security/limits.conf
# &lt;domain&gt;      &lt;type&gt;  &lt;item&gt;         &lt;value&gt;
your_username  hard    nofile          4096
</pre></div>

This would raise the hard limit to 4096 files. Also have a look at the 
overall limit of the operating system
<div class="code"><pre>
cat /proc/sys/fs/file-max
</pre></div>
which is on modern Linux systems several 100,000 files.

<p>Use the <em>-z</em> flag to analyze large amount of raster maps 
without hitting open files limit and the size limit of command line 
arguments. This will however increase the processing time. For every 
single row in the output map(s) all input maps are opened and closed. 
The amount of RAM will rise linear with the number of specified input 
maps.
<p>
The input and file options are mutually exclusive. Input is a 
text file with a new line separated list of raster map names.

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

Determine occurrence/number of seasons with their respective start and 
end dates (in the form of map indexes) in global NDVI data. Let's use 
the example from <em>i.modis.import</em> to download and import NDVI
global data and, create a time series with it:

<div class="code"><pre>
# download two years of data: MOD13C1, global NDVI, 16-days, 5600 m
i.modis.download settings=~/.rmodis product=ndvi_terra_sixteen_5600 \
  startday=2015-01-01 endday=2016-12-31 folder=$USER/data/ndvi_MOD13C1.006

# import band 1 = NDVI
i.modis.import -w files=$USER/data/ndvi_MOD13C1.006/listfileMOD13C1.006.txt \
  spectral="( 1 )" method=bilinear outfile=$HOME/list_for_tregister.csv

# create empty temporal DB
t.create type=strds temporaltype=absolute output=ndvi_16_5600m \
  title="Global NDVI 16 days MOD13C1" \
  description="MOD13C1 Global NDVI 16 days" semantictype=mean

# register datasets (using outfile from i.modis.import -w)
t.register input=ndvi_16_5600m file=$HOME/list_for_tregister.csv
</pre></div>

First, visualize the NDVI time series in a particular point with 
<em>g.gui.tplot</em>:

<div class="code"><pre>
g.gui.tplot strds=ndvi_16_5600m coordinates=146.537059538,-29.744835966
</pre></div>

<div align="center" style="margin: 10px">
<a href="global_ndvi.png">
<img src="global_ndvi.png" width="500" height="361" alt="Global NDVI from MOD13C1 product" border=0>
<a href="time_series_ndvi.png">
<img src="time_series_ndvi.png" width="400" height="329" alt="NDVI time series, 2015-2016" border=0>
</a><br>
<i>Global NDVI from MOD13C1 product (right) and an example of a time series in southeastern Australia (left).</i>
</div>

<p>
Now, identify seasons based on a fixed threshold and a minimum duration. 
The threshold and duration were visually estimated from the time series 
plot for the example.

<div class="code"><pre>
r.seasons input=`g.list rast pat=MOD13* sep=,` prefix=ndvi_season n=3 \
  nout=ndvi_season threshold_value=3000 min_length=6

# the outputs are: 
g.list type=raster pattern=ndvi_season*
ndvi_season
ndvi_season1_end1
ndvi_season1_end2
ndvi_season1_start1
ndvi_season1_start2
ndvi_season2_end1
ndvi_season2_end2
ndvi_season2_start1
ndvi_season2_start2
ndvi_season3_end1
ndvi_season3_end2
ndvi_season3_start1
ndvi_season3_start2
</pre></div>

<p>
And finally, let's visualize ndvi_season and start1 and end1 of season 2:

<div class="code"><pre>
# set comparable color table to plot start and end
r.colors map=ndvi_season2_start1,ndvi_season2_end1 color=viridis
</pre></div>

<div align="center" style="margin: 10px">
<a href="number_seasons_ndvi.png">
<img src="number_seasons_ndvi.png" width="600" height="433" alt="Number of seasons in global NDVI" border=0>
</a><br>
<i>Number of seasons in global NDVI, 2015-2016.</i>
</div>

<p>
<div align="center" style="margin: 10px">
<a href="ndvi_season2_start1.png">
<img src="ndvi_season2_start1.png" width="500" height="361" alt="Start of season 2" border=0>
<a href="ndvi_season2_end1.png">
<img src="ndvi_season2_end1.png" width="500" height="361" alt="End of season 2" border=0>
</a><br>
<i>Start (right) and end (left) of season 2 (unit is map index).</i>
</div>
