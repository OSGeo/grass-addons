<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

The purpose of <em>r.windfetch</em> is to compute wind fetch,
which is the length of water over which winds blow without obstruction.
Fetch is an important feature in wave modeling for waves created by wind.

<p>
Input is a binary raster map <b>input</b> where land is 1 and 0 is water.
To compute fetch for certain point(s), user provides either the coordinates
with the <b>coordinates</b> parameter or a points vector map with <b>points</b> parameter.
Output is formatted with <b>format</b> parameter either as JSON or CSV and can
be printed to a file (<b>output_file</b>) or to standard output.


<h2>NOTES</h2>
Wind fetch is computed for specific directions, determined by parameters <b>direction</b>
and <b>step</b>. Direction angle is in degrees counterclockwise from the East. For example,
for <code>direction=45</code> and <code>step=90</code>, <em>r.windfetch</em> computes fetch
for directions 45, 135, 225, and 315 (NE, NW, SW, SE).

By default wind fetch for each direction is averaged from multiple directions
around it. The number of minor directions from which the main direction is computed
is specified with parameter <b>minor_directions</b>. The step between the minor directions
is given in <b>minor_step</b> and is in degrees.


<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>
Compute wind fetch on a lake edge with default parameters:
<div class="code"><pre>
r.mapcalc "land = if (isnull(lakes), 1, 0)"
r.windfetch input=land format=csv coordinates=635659,223234
</pre></div>
