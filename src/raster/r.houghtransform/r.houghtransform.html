<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.houghtransform</em> is performing vector line extraction from edges,
or generally any raster lines, in a raster map using the Hough transform.
An edge is considered as potential line feature previously detected by
some other algorithm represented by value 1 in the raster map.

<p>
In general, the Hough transform is a method for finding geometry structures in
images. This module uses the Hough transform for straight line detection.
Extracted line segments can be used to construct rectangles or generally
any other polygons.
The transformation itself creates a raster image which is then
used for finding line segments. The input of Hough transform is an image which
contains only edges, or generally any lines, represented as raster map.
It is not necessary but for practical reasons, these edges or lines should
be thin e.g., those produced <em><a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/r.thin.html">r.thin</a></em> module
or by <em><a href="i.edge.html">i.edge</a></em> module (Canny edge detector).


<h3>Algorithm</h3>

<p>
Lines can be mathematically represented in many ways. For this module,
the following representation was chosen. Line is represented in polar
coordinates where <i>r</i> is the distance between the line and the origin
and <i>&#920;</i> is the angle of the vector from the origin to the closest
point. The equation follows.

<p>
<i>r</i> = <i>x</i> cos(&#920;) + <i>y</i> sin(&#920;)

<p>
When applying Hough transformation for streight lines,
the point in the original image leads to a sinusoidal curve in the transformed
image. Points in the original image belonging to one line result in sinusoids
intersecting in one point in the transformed image (Hough space).
The coordinates of this point describe the parameters <i>r</i>, <i>&#920;</i>
of the line and its value represents the number of points of the line.

<p>
In other words, points from the original image with <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>
axes are transformed into the Hough space with <i>r</i> and <i>&#920;</i>
axes. We can say that the resulting (transformed) image is the
Hough image. One point (pixel) in the original image is represented by a curve
in the Hough image and one point in the Hough image defines a line in
the original image by  <i>r</i> and <i>&#920;</i> parameters. One line in
the original image is represented by an intersection of curves.
More points (pixels) in one line lead to a higher value in the point of
curves' intersection.

<p>
For further evaluation, it is necessary to extract local maximum values from
the Hough image which correspond to significant lines of the original image.
This way we obtain the desired lines in form of <i>r</i>, <i>&#920;</i>
coordinate pairs. However, we do not obtain the end coordinates of the
original line segment (<i>r</i>, <i>&#920;</i> are line parameters).

<p>
To extract significant lines from Hough image, <em>r.houghtransform</em>
module uses the <em>identify and remove</em> Hough transform method described
in [Fiala2003].
As mentioned above, it is needed to extract the local maxima representing
the lines from the result of the Hough image. This task is compliated by
the because presence of noise in the original image.
The <em>identify and remove</em> Hough transform method provides
not just the line parameters but also the actual coordinates of points as
a byproduct. It is based on the idea of sequential removing peaks
from the transformation result and eliminating the effect caused by
the points of original image belonging to the removed peak.

<p>
Lines obtained by  <em>identify and remove</em> Hough transform method
had to be processed in order to get the actual line segments from the
original image. Due to the noise in the original image, certain points
can be included in the detected line although they do not belong to it.
The subsequent step &mdash; extraction of line segments &mdash; has to
ignore the outlying pixels. However, the main goal is to find separate
line segments (pixels belonging to one line segment), so that the line
segment is not interrupted. The method needs to tolerate also small gaps
because some line segments can actually be interrupted, e.g. by vegetation.
On the other hand, these gaps cannot be too frequent because many
interruptions would indicate line segments which are probably not part of
the feature. The serious line interruption means that there are two segments
on one line in the image. As a result, the produced output can be more
than one line segment for one detected line.


<p>
The Hough transform can be optimized by providing directions of
edges [Galambos2000] (possible result of the Canny edge detector or other
 edge detection algorithm).
These angles are used to search only pixels which are in the direction
of the particular line.
The <em>r.houghtransform</em> module uses exactly this approach.

<p>
It must be noted that line segment reconstruction does not have to be
considered as a part of Hough transformation. The basic result of
Hough transformation is the transformed image (Hough image). Thus,
<em>r.houghtransform</em> module provides the posibilty to export also
this image.

<p>
However, for implementation of the <em>identify and remove</em>
Hough transform method, it is necessary and also very advantageous to create
data structures instead of an image because of the need for backtracking
the lines to the original image. As a result, <em>r.houghtransform</em> module
combines Hough transformation and its <em>identify and remove</em> extension,
so that the primary result are the line segments.


<p>
From the transformed image (Hough image), we can infer certain rules and
symmetries, e.g. four peeks at certain positions may denote a rectangle.
So possibly, some algorithms can use the Hough image to detect features in
different ways than <em>identify and remove</em> Hough transform method.
However, these algorithms are not part of <em>r.houghtransform</em> module,
just the Hough image is provided.


<h3>Inputs and outputs</h3>

<p>
The main purpose of the module is to detect line segments, so the output
is a vector map which contains line segments found in the input raster
edge map. The level of details is controlled by several parameters.
The continuous straight series of pixels are interpreted as a part of
a line when they are not too scattered (thus possible line width or
line inaccuracy is limited). The algorithm tolerates small and not too
often repeated gaps. As a result, the <em>r.houghtransform</em> module
can produce more than one line segment for one detected line when the gap
is too long. All the limits mentioned above as well as the minimum length
of line segment can also be controlled by the user as well as the approximate
number of all resulting lines.

<p>
The edge directions (e.g. the optional output of
<em><a href="i.edge.html">i.edge</a></em>) can serve as an additional input to
<em>r.houghtransform</em> module. The availability of edge directions
reduces significantly the time needed for the computation without
any negative effect on the result.

<p>
The optional output of <em>r.houghtransform</em> module is the image
transformed into the Hough space (Hough image), i.e. the original output
of the Hough transformation. It can be used for further processing and
analysis if desired. The image is outputted as a raster map at
coordinates (0,0). One image pixel is represented as one cell
but the image does not have any geographical meaning (it is in Hough space).
Note that Hough image does not contain all the information which is
used to construct line segments (namely, the backtracking information).
The color table of this image is set to gray scale with the black
representing a zero. Note that the number of curves in this image is
significantly reduced when you provide angle map as an optional input.
So, if you want to get nicely looking image, you shall not provide angle
map to <em>r.houghtransform</em> module.
