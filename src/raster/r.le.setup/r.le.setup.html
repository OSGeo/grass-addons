<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.le.setup</em> program is used to set
up the sampling and analysis framework that will be used by the other
<em>r.le</em> programs.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

<i>Full instructions can be found in the <b>r.le manual</b> (see "REFERENCES"
section below).</i>
<p>

The first menu allows the user to define a rectangular sampling frame, 
select how sampling will be done (regions, sampling units, moving window), 
setup the limits for groups and classes, and change the color table.  
Use the left mouse button to make your choice.

<p>

Information about the structure of the landscape is obtained by overlaying 
a set of sampling areas on top of a specified part (the sampling frame of 
a map layer, and then calculating specific structural measures for the part 
of the map layer that corresponds to the area in each sampling area.  

<p>

To setup a <em><b>sampling frame</b></em> click on SAMPLING FRAME in the 
main menu.  The program will ask "Will the sampling frame (total area 
within which sampling units are distributed) be the whole map? (y/n)  [y]"  
Just hit a carriage return to accept the default, which is to use the 
whole map.  You do not need to setup a sampling frame if you want to use 
the whole map, as this is the default.  To setup a different sampling 
frame type "n" in response to this question.  Then use the mouse and a 
rubber band box to outline a rectangular sampling frame on screen.  
This box will be moved to the nearest row and column of the map.  
You will be asked last whether you want to "Refresh the screen before
choosing more setup?"  If you don't like the sampling frame you just setup, 
answer yes to this question, then click on SAMPLING FRAME again to redo 
this part of the setup.  This sampling frame will be used in all subsequent 
setup procedures unless you change it.  You can change it at any time by 
simply clicking on SAMPLING FRAME again.  

<p>

A <em><b>sampling area</b></em> may be one of four things.  First, it is 
possible to treat the entire map layer as the one (and only) sampling area.  
Second, if the map layer can be divided into meaningful geographical regions, 
then it is possible to treat the regions themselves as sampling areas.  
The third option is that the sampling areas may be sampling units of 
fixed shape and size (also called scale) that are placed within the map 
layer as a whole.  The fourth and final option is that the sampling area 
may be moved systematically across the map as a moving window. 

<p>

If regions are to be used as the sampling areas , then the user can use 
<em>r.le.setup</em> to draw regions or any existing map of regions can 
simply be used directly.  To draw regions and create a new regions map 
in <em>r.le.setup</em> select "REGIONS" from the first <em>r.le.setup</em> 
menu, and the user is asked to do the following:

<dl>
<pre>
1.  "ENTER THE NEW REGION MAP NAME:". Only a new raster map name is 
acceptable. The user can type LIST to find out the existing raster map 
names in this location and mapset.

2. "PLEASE OUTLINE REGION # 1". The user should move the mouse cursor 
into the graphic monitor window and use the mouse buttons as instructed:
Left button: where am I.to display the current coordinates of the cursor.
Middle button: Mark start (next) point. to enter a vertex of the region 
boundary.
Right button: Finish region-connect to 1st point to close the region 
boundary by setting the last vertex to be equal to the first one.

3. A "REGION OPTIONS:" menu is displayed and the user should use the mouse 
to select one of
   the options:<br>
"DRAW MORE": repeat the above process and setup another region.
"START OVER": abandon the previous setup and start all over again.
"DONE-SAVE": save the regions outlined so far and exit this procedure.
"QUIT-NO SAVE": quit the procedure without saving the regions.
</pre>
</dl>

Once the "DONE-SAVE" option is selected, the new raster map of the sampling 
regions is generated. It is displayed on the monitor window for several 
seconds, the monitor window is refreshed, the main menu is displayed again, 
and the program is ready for other setup work.  Note that you cannot draw 
regions in areas outside the mask, if a mask is present (see <em>r.mask</em> 
command).

<p>

The user can also use the GRASS <em><a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/wxGUI.vdigit.html">wxGUI vector digitizer</a></em> 
to digitize circular or polygonal regions and to create a 
sampling regions map without using <em>r.le.setup</em>.  Or, as mentioned
above, an existing raster map can be used as a regions map.

<p>

If sampling units are to be used as the sampling areas (Fig. 2), then 
choose "SAMPLING UNITS" from the first <em>r.le.setup</em> menu.  
The program checks the <em>r.le.para</em> subdirectory for an existing 
"units" file from a previous setup session and allows the user to rename 
this file (to save it) before proceeding.  The r.le.setup program will 
otherwise overwrite the "units" file.  Then the following choice is 
displayed followed by a series of other choices:

<dl>
<dd>
<pre>
	Which do you want to do?
	   (1) Use the keyboard to enter sampling unit parameters
	   (2) Draw the sampling units with the mouse
							Enter 1 or 2:

</pre>
</dl>

When sampling units are defined using the keyboard, the user inputs the 
shape and size (scale) of the sampling units by specifying dimensions 
in pixels using the keyboard.  When sampling units are drawn with the 
mouse, the user clicks the mouse to define the sampling units in the 
GRASS monitor window, and then actually places the sampling units for 
each scale onto the map.  By placing the units with the mouse the user 
can directly determine the method of sampling unit distribution as well 
as the shape, size, and number of sampling units.

<p>

If the choice is made to define sampling units using the keyboard, the 
following series of questions must be answered:

<dl>
<dd>
<pre>
	How many different SCALES do you want (1-15)?
</pre>
</dl>

The user is asked to specify the number of scales that will be used.  
The <em>r.le</em> programs allow the user to simultaneously sample the 
same map with the same measures using sampling areas of different sizes.  
Currently there can be between 1 and 15 scales that can be sampled 
simultaneously. Substantial output can be produced if many scales are used.

<p>

Sampling units must be placed spatially into the landscape.  There are 
five options for doing this : 

<p>

<em>Random nonoverlapping</em><br>
Sampling units are placed in the landscape by randomly choosing numbers 
that specify the location of the upper left corner of each sampling unit, 
subject to the constraint that successive sampling units not overlap other 
sampling units or the edge of the landscape, and that they must be entirely 
within the area defined by the mask (see <em>r.mask</em> command) if one 
exists.

<p>

<em>Systematic contiguous</em><br>
Sampling units are placed side by side across the rows.  The user will 
be able to enter a row and column to indicate where the upper left corner 
of the systematic contiguous framework should be placed.  Rows are numbered 
from the top down beginning with row 1 of the sampling frame.  Columns are 
numbered from left to right, beginning with column 1 of the sampling frame.  
A random starting location can be obtained by using a standard random 
number table to choose the starting row and column.  The <em>r.le.setup</em> 
program does not avoid placing the set of sampling units over areas 
outside the mask.  The user will have to make sure that sampling units do 
not extend outside the mask by choosing a particular starting row and 
column or by drawing a sampling frame before placing the set of sampling 
units.

<p>

<em>Systematic noncontiguous</em><br>
The user must specify the starting row and column as in #2 above and the 
amount of spacing (in pixels) between sampling units.  Horizontal and 
vertical spacing are identical.  Sampling units are again placed side by 
side (but spaced) across the rows.  As in #2 the program does not avoid 
placing sampling units outside the masked area; the user will have to 
position the set of units to avoid areas outside the mask.

<p>

<em>Stratified random</em><br>
The strata are rectangular areas within which single sampling units 
are randomly located.  The user must first specify the starting row 
and column as in #2 above.  Then the user must specify the number of 
strata in the horizontal and vertical directions.   As in #2 the program 
does not avoid placing sampling units outside the masked area; the user 
will have to position the set of units to avoid areas outside the mask.

<p>

<em>Centered over sites</em><br>
The user must specify the name of a sitefile containing point locations.  
A single sampling unit is placed with its center over each site in the site 
file.  This is a useful approach for determining the landscape structure 
around points, such as around the location of wildlife observations.

<p>

The user is prompted to enter a ratio that defines the shape of the 
sampling units.  Sampling units may have any rectangular shape, 
including square as a special case of rectangular.  Rectangular shapes 
are specified by entering the ratio of columns/rows (horizontal 
dimension/vertical dimension) as a real number.  For example, to obtain 
a sampling unit 10 columns wide by 4 rows long specify the ratio as 2.5 
(10/4).
<dl>
<dd>
<pre>
	Recommended maximum SIZE is m in x cell total area. <br>
	What size (in cells) for each sampling unit of scale n?
</pre>
</dl>

The user is then given the recommended maximum possible size for a 
sampling unit (in pixels) and asked to input the size of sampling units 
at each scale.  Sampling units can be of any size, but the maximum size 
is the size of the landscape as a whole.  All the sampling units, that 
make up a single sampling scale, are the same size.  After specifying 
the size, the program determines the nearest actual number of rows and 
columns, and hence size, that is closest to the requested size, given 
the shape requested earlier.
<dl>
<dd>
<pre>
	The nearest size is x cells wide X y cells high = xy cells
	Is this size OK?  (y/n)  [y]

	Maximum NUMBER of units in scale n is p?
	What NUMBER of sampling units do you want to try to use?
</pre>
</dl>

The maximum number of units that can be placed over the map, given the 
shape and size of the units, is then given.  The user can then choose 
the number of sampling units to be used in the map layer.  It may not 
always be possible to choose the maximum number, depending upon the 
shape of the sampling units.  In the case of systematic contiguous and 
noncontiguous, the program will indicate how many units will fit across 
the columns and down the rows.  The user can then specify a particular 
layout (e.g., 6 units could be placed as 2 rows of 3 per row or as 3 
rows of 2 per row).
<dl>
<dd>
<pre>
	Is this set of sampling units OK?  (y/n)  [y]
</pre>
</dl>

Finally, the set of sampling units is displayed on the screen (e.g., Fig. 1) 
and the user is asked whether it is acceptable.  If the answer is no, then 
the user is asked if the screen should be refreshed before redisplaying 
the menu for "Methods of sampling unit distribution" so that the user can 
try the sampling unit setup again.

<p>

The choice is made to define sampling units using the mouse, then the 
following menu for use with the mouse is displayed:
<dl>
<dd>
<pre>
	Outline the standard sampling unit of scale n.
	   Left button:	Check unit size
	   Middle button:	Move cursor
	   Right button:	Lower right corner of unit here
</pre>
</dl>

The user can then use the mouse and the rubber band box to outline the 
standard sampling unit.  Once it has been outlined, the number of columns 
and rows in the unit, the ratio of width/length and the size of the unit, 
in cells, will be displayed.  After this first unit is outlined, then a 
new menu is displayed:
<dl>
<dd>
<pre>
	Outline more sampling units of scale n?
	   Left button:	Exit
	   Middle button:	Check unit position
	   Right button:	Lower right corner of next unit here
</pre>
</dl>

The user can then place more units identical to the standard unit by 
simply clicking the right mouse button where the lower right corner of 
the unit should be placed.  The rest of the rubber band box can be 
ignored while placing additional units.  The program is set up so that 
units cannot be placed so they overlap one another, so they overlap the 
area outside the mask, or so they overlap the edge of the sampling frame.  
Warning messages are issued for all three of these errors and a sampling 
unit is simply not placed.

<p>

Using this procedure a rectangular "window" or single sampling area is 
moved systematically across the map to produce a new map (Fig. 2,3).  
This sampling procedure can only be used with the measures that produce 
a single value or with a single class or group when measures produce 
distributions of values (Table 1).  The first class or group specified 
when defining class or group limits (section 2.3.2.) is used if 
distributional measures are chosen with the moving window sampling 
method.  In this case, the user should manually edit the 
<em>r.le.para/recl_tb</em> file so that the desired group is listed as 
the first group in this file. 

<p>

Sampling begins with the upper left corner of the window placed over 
the upper left corner of the sampling frame.  It is strongly recommended 
that the user read the section on the GRASS mask (section 2.2.2) prior 
to setting up the moving window, as this mask can be used to speed up 
the moving window operation.  The value of the chosen measure is 
calculated for the window area.  This value is assigned to the location 
on the new map layer corresponding to the center pixel in the window if 
the window has odd (e.g. 3 X 3) dimensions.  The value is assigned to 
the location on the new map layer corresponding to the first pixel below 
and to the right of the center if the window has even dimensions 
(e.g. 6 X 10).  If this pixel has the value "0," which means "no data" in 
GRASS, then this pixel is skipped and a value of "0" is assigned to the 
corresponding location in the new map.  The window is then moved to the 
right (across the row) by one pixel, and the process is repeated. 
At the end of the row, the window is moved down one pixel, and then back 
across the row.  This option produces a new map layer, whose dimensions 
are smaller by approximately (m-1)/2 rows and columns, where m is the 
number of rows or columns in the window.  

<p>

If the "MOVE-WINDOW" option in the main menu is selected, first the 
program checks for an existing "move_wind" file, in the r.le.para 
subdirectory, containing moving window specifications from a previous 
session.  The user is given the option to avoid overwriting this file 
by entering a new file name for the old "move_wind" file.  Users should 
be aware that moving window analyses are very slow, because a large 
number of sampling units are, in effect, used.  See the appendix on 
"Time needed to complete analyses with the r.le programs" for some 
ideas about how moving window size and sampling frame area affect 
the needed time to complete the analyses.

<p>

The <em>r.le</em> programs <em>r.le.dist</em> and <em>r.le.patch</em> 
allow the attribute categories in the input map to be reclassed into 
several attribute groups, and reports the analysis results by each of 
these attribute groups.  It is necessary to setup group limits for 
all measures that say "by gp" when typing "<em>r.le.dist help</em>" 
or "<em>r.le.patch help</em>" at the GRASS prompt.  The same reclassing 
can be done with the measurement indices (e.g., size), except that each 
"cohort" (class) of the reclassed indices is called an index class 
instead of a group.  It is also necessary to setup class limits for 
all measures that say "by class" when typing "<em>r.le.dist help</em>" 
or "<em>r.le.patch help</em>" at the GRASS prompt.  

<p>

Group/class limits are setup by choosing "GROUP/CLASS LIMITS" from the 
main menu upon starting <em>r.le.setup</em>, or you can create the files 
manually using a text editor.  The program checks for existing group/class 
limit files in subdirectory <em>r.le.para</em> and allows the user to 
rename these files prior to continuing.  If the files are not renamed 
the program will overwrite them.  The files are named recl_tb (attribute 
group limits), size (size class limits), shape_PA (shape index class 
limits for perimeter/area index), shape_CPA (shape index class limits 
for corrected perimeter/area index), shape_RCC (shape index class limits 
for related circumscribing circle index), and from_to (for the 
<em>r.le.dist</em> program distance methods m7-m9). 

<p>

Attribute groups and index classes are defined in a different way.  
In the <em>r.le</em> programs attribute groups are defined as in the 
following example:
<dl>
<dd>
<pre>
	1, 3, 5, 7, 9 <b>thru</b> 21 = 1 (comment)
	31 <b>thru</b> 50 = 2 (comment)
	<b>end</b>
</pre>
</dl>

In this example, the existing categories 1, 3, 5, 7, {9, 10, ... 20, 21} 
are included in the new group 1, while {31, 32, 33, ..., 49, 50} are 
included in the new group 2.  The characters in bold are the "key words" 
that are required in the definition.  Each line is called one "reclass rule".

<p>

The GRASS reclass convention is adopted here with a little modification 
(see "<em>r.reclass</em>" command in the GRASS User's Manual).  
The difference is that r.le only allows one rule for each group while the 
GRASS <em>r.reclass</em> command allows more than one. The definition of 
"from" and "to" groups is simply the extension of the GRASS reclass rule.  
The advantage of using the GRASS reclass convention is that the user can
generate a permanent reclassed map, using GRASS programs, directly from the 
<em>r.le</em> setup results.

<p>

The <em>r.le</em> measurement index classes are defined by the lower 
limits of the classes, as in the following example:
<dl>
<dd>
<pre>
	0.0, 10.0, 50.0, 200.0, <b>-999</b>
</pre>
</dl>

This means: 
<dl>
<dd>
<pre>
	if v &gt;= 0.0 and v &lt; 10.0 then  v belongs to index class 1;
	if v &gt;= 10.0 and v &lt; 50.0 then  v belongs to index class 2;
	if v &gt;= 50.0 and v &lt; 200.0 then v belongs to index class 3;
	if v &gt;= 200.0 then v belongs to index class 4;
</pre>
</dl>

where v is the calculated index value and <b>-999</b> marks the end of 
the index class definition. The measurement index can be the size index, 
one of the three shape indices, or one of the three distance indices.  
The program is currently designed to allow no more than 25 attribute 
groups, 25 size classes, 25 shape index classes, and 25 distance index 
classes.  As an alternative, the user may want to permanently group 
certain attributes prior to entering the <em>r.le</em> programs.  
For example, the user may want to group attributes 1-10, in a map whose 
attributes are ages, into a single attribute representing young patches.  
The user can do this using the GRASS <em>r.reclass</em> and 
<em>r.resample</em> commands, which will create a new map layer that can 
then be analyzed directly (without setting up group limits) with the 
<em>r.le</em> programs.
