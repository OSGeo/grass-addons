<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.viewshed.cva</em> is a module that allows for the 
construction of "Cumulative Viewshed", or "visualscape" maps from a 
series of input points stored in a vector points map. The routine is 
a python wrapper script that iterative loops through each input 
point, calculating a viewshed map, and then creates an output map 
that is coded by the number of input locations that can "see" each 
cell. <em>r.viewshed.cva</em> uses the GRASS GIS module <em>r.viewshed</em>
for the viewshed analysis. <em>r.viewshed</em> is very fast, 
thus allowing for a cumulative viewshed analysis to run in a 
reasonable amount of time. The final cumulative viewshed map is 
computed using the "count" method of <em>r.series</em>, rather than 
with mapcalc, as it better handles the null values in the individual 
constituent viewshed maps (and allows for interim viewshed maps to 
be coded in any way).

<h3>Options and flags</h3>

<em>r.viewshed.cva</em> requires an input elevation map, <b>input</b>, 
and an input vector points map, <b>vector</b>. There is currently only
 one native flag for <em>r.viewshed.cva</em>, <b>-k</b>, which allows
 you to keep the interim viewshed maps made for each input point. 
Optionally, option <b>name_column</b> can be used with <b>-k</b> to specify 
the suffix of the kept viewshed maps by a particular column in the 
input vector points' database. If no value is specified for <b>name_column</b>, 
then the cat value will be used.
<p>
All other flags and options are inherited from 
<em>r.viewshed</em>
(see the <em><a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/r.viewshed.html">r.viewshed</a></em>
help page for more information on these).

<h2>NOTES</h2>

The input vector points map can be manually digitized (with <em>
v.digit</em>) over topographic or cultural features, or can be 
created as a series of random points (with <em>r.random</em> or <em>
v.random</em>). Note that using the flag -k allows you to keep any 
interim viewshed maps created during the analysis, and these resultant 
viewshed maps will be named according to the cat number of the original
input points. This is also useful for simple creating a large number
of individual viewsheds from points in a vector file.
<p>
An automated summit extraction can be done with <b>r.geomorphon</b>.

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

Undertake a cumulative viewshed analysis from a digitized vector points
map of prominent peaks in a region (North Carolina sample dataset):<br>

<div class="code"><pre>
g.region raster=elevation -p
# use v.digit to digitize points or e.g. the r.geomorphon addon for summits
r.viewshed.cva input=elevation output=peaks_CVA_map \
  vector=prominent_peaks_points name_column=cat \
  observer_elevation=1.75 target_elevation=0
</pre></div>


<br>Undertake a cumulative viewshed analysis from a 10% sample of
landscape locations in a region:<br>

<div class="code"><pre>
g.region raster=elevation -p
r.random input=elevation n=10% vector=rand_points_10p
r.viewshed.cva input=elevation output=peaks_CVA_map \
  vector=rand_points_10p name_column=cat \
  observer_elevation=1.75 target_elevation=0
</pre></div>
