<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.viewshed.cva</em> is a module that allows for the 
construction of "Cumulative Viewshed", or "visualscape" maps from a 
series of input points stored in a vector points map. The routine is 
a python wrapper script that iterative loops through each input 
point, calculating a viewshed map, and then creates an output map 
that is coded by the number of input locations that can "see" each 
cell. <em>r.viewshed.cva</em> uses the GRASS addon <em>r.viewshed</em>
for the viewshed analysis (instead of the standard module <it>r.los</it>)
because <it>r.viewshed</it> is substantially faster, 
thus allowing for a cumulative viewshed analysis to run in a 
reasonable amount of time. The final cumulative viewshed map is 
computed using the "count" method of <it>r.series</it>, rather than 
with mapcalc, as it better handles the null values in the individual 
constituent viewshed maps (and allows for interim viewshed maps to 
be coded in any way)

<h3>Options and flags:</h3>

<it>r.viewshed.cva</it> requires an input elevation map and an input 
vector points map with at least three columns of data: one contains 
a unique identifier for each point (e.g., "cat"), one contains the 
easting of the point, and one contains the northing of the point. 
There is currently only one native flag for <it>r.viewshed.cva</it> 
(-k), which allows you to keep the interim viewshed maps made for 
each input point. All other flags and options are inherited from 
r.viewshed (see the<it> r.viewshed</it> help page for more 
information on these).

<h2>NOTES</h2>

The input vector points map can be manually digitized (with <it>
v.digit</it>) over topographic or cultural features, or can be 
created as a series of random points (with <it>r.random</it> or <it>
v.random</it>). The required "name_column" can be any alpha numeric 
value, as long as it is unique for each input point. The required 
"x_column" and "y_column" columns can be added with <it>v.db.addcol</it>,
and the eastings and northings uploaded to these columns with 
<it>v.to.db</it>. Note that using the flag -k allows you to keep any 
interim viewshed maps created during the analysis. This is also 
useful for simple creating a large number of individual viewsheds 
from points in a vector file.

<p>
	
Also note that you must first install the GRASS addon <it>r.viewshed
</it> before you can use this module. <it>r.viewshed</it> offers 
several significant advnatages over <it>r.los</it>, not least a 
great increase in processing speed. Use of <it>r.los</it> would mean 
that only a small number of input points could be used. Use of
<it>r.viewshed</it> means that a much larger number of points could be 
used (trials showed that viewsheds were calculated for 100 input 
points in about 1.5 hrs at a 10m resolution for a region spanning 
some 40km by 10km).

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>
Undertake a cumulative viewshed analysis from a digitized vector points map of prominent peaks in a region:<br>

<div class="code"><pre>
g.region rast=elevation_10m_dem@PERMANENT -p
v.db.addcol map=prominent_peaks_points@PERMANENT columns=x double, y double
v.to.db map=prominent_peaks_points@PERMANENT option=coor columns=x,y
r.viewshed.cva.py elev=elevation10m_demPERMANENT output=peaks_CVA_map \
  vect=prominent_peaks_points@PERMANENT x_column=x y_column=y \
  name_column=cat obs_elev=0.0 tgt_elev=1.75 max_dist=-1 mem=1500
</pre></div>


<br>Undertake a cumulative viewshed analysis from a 10% sample of landscape locations in a region:<br>

<div class="code"><pre>
g.region rast=elevation_10m_dem@PERMANENT
r.random input=elevation10m_demPERMANENT n=10% vector_output=rand_points_10p
v.db.addcol map=rand_points_10p@PERMANENT columns=x double, y double
v.to.db map=rand_points_10p@PERMANENT option=coor columns=x,y
r.viewshed.cva.py elev=elevation10m_demPERMANENT output=peaks_CVA_map \
  vect=rand_points_10p@PERMANENT x_column=x y_column=y \
  name_column=cat obs_elev=0.0 tgt_elev=1.75 max_dist=-1 mem=1500
</pre></div>
