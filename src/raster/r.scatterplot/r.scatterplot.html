<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

The <em>r.scatterplot</em> module takes raster maps and creates
a scatter plot which is a vector map and where individual points in
the scatter plot are vector points. As with any scatter plot the X
coordinates of the points represent values from the first raster map
and the Y coordinates represent values from the second raster map.
Consequently, the vector map is placed in the combined value space of
the original raster maps and its geographic position should be ignored.
Typically, it is necessary to zoom or to change computational in order
to view the scatter plot or to perform further computations on the result.

<p>
With the default settings, the <em>r.scatterplot</em> output allows
measuring and querying of the values in the scatter plot. Settings
such as <b>xscale</b> or <b>position</b> option change the coordinates
and make some of the measurements wrong.


<h3>Multiple variables</h3>

If more than two raster maps are provided to the <b>input</b> option,
<em>r.scatterplot</em> creates a scatter plot for each unique pair
of input maps. For example, if A, B, C, and D are the inputs,
<em>r.scatterplot</em> creates scatter plots for A and B, A and C,
A and D, B and C, B and D, and finally C and D. Each pair is part of
different vector map layer. <em>r.scatterplot</em> provides textual
output which specifies the pairs and associated layers.

<p>
A 3D scatter plot can be generated when the <b>z_raster</b> option is
provided. A third variable is added to each scatter plot and each point
has Z coordinate which represents this third variable.

<p>
Each point can also have a color based on an additional variable
based on the values from <b>color_raster</b>. Values from a raster are
stored as categories, i.e. floating point values are truncated to
integers, and a color table based on the input raster color table is
assigned to the vector map.

<p>
The <b>z_raster</b> and <b>color_raster</b> can be the same. This can help
with understanding the 3D scatter plot and makes the third variable
visible in 2D as well.
When <b>z_raster</b> and <b>color_raster</b> are the same, total of four
variables are associated with one point.

<h3>Layout</h3>

When working only with variable, X axis represents the first one
and Y axis the second one. With more than one variable, the individual
scatter plots for individual pairs of variables are at the same
place. In this case, the coordinates show the actual values of the
variables. Each scatter plot is placed into a separate layer of
the output vector map.

<!--
r.scatterplot input=lsat7_2002_30,lsat7_2002_40,lsat7_2002_50 output=scatterplot
d.vect -c map=scatterplot layer=-1 color=none width=1 icon=basic/point

</em></p>
</center>

<p>
If visualization is more important than preserving the actual values,
the <b>-s</b> flag can be used. This will place the scatter plots next
to each other separated by values provided using <b>spacing</b> option.

<p>
The layout options can be still combined with additional variables
represented as Z coordinate or color. In that case, Z coordinate
or color is same for all the scatter plots.

The options <b>xscale</b>, <b>yscale</b> and <b>zscale</b> will cause
the values to be rescaled before they are stored as point coordinates.
This is useful for visualization when one of the variables has
significantly different range than the other or when the scatter plot
is shown with other data and must fit a certain area.

The <b>position</b> option is used to place the scatter plot to any
given coordinates. Similarly, <b>-w</b> flag can be used to place it
to the south-west corner of the computation region.


<h2>NOTES</h2>

<p>
The resulting vector will have as many points as there is 3D raster
cells in the current computational region. It might be appropriate to
use coarser resolution for the scatter plot than for the other
computations. However, note that the some values will be skipped
which may lead, e.g. to missing some outliers.

<p>
The <b>color_raster</b> input is expected to be categorical raster
or have values which won't loose anything when converted from floating
point to integer. This is because vector categories are used to store
the <b>color_raster</b> values and carry association with the color.

<p>
The visualization of the output vector map has potentially the same
issue as visualization of any vector with many points. The points
cover each other and above certain density of points, it is not possible
to compare relative density in the scatter plot. Furthermore, if colors
are associated with the points, the colors of points rendered last are
those which are visible, not actually showing the prevailing color
(value). The modules <em><a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/v.mkgrid.html">v.mkgrid</a></em> and
<em><a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/v.vect.stats.html">v.vect.stats</a></em> can be used to
overcome this issue.

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

<h3>Landsat bands</h3>

In the full North Carolina sample location,
set the computation region to one of the raster maps:

<div class="code"><pre>
g.region raster=lsat7_2002_30
</pre></div>

Create the scatter plot:

<div class="code"><pre>
r.scatterplot input=lsat7_2002_30,lsat7_2002_40 output=scatterplot color_raster=landclass96
</pre></div>

<!--
d.vect map=scatterplot color=none width=1 icon=basic/point
d.legend -c raster=landclass96
-->

<center>
<img src="r_scatterplot.png">
<p><em>

    colored using land cover classes
</em></p>
</center>


<h3>High density scatter plots</h3>

In an ideal case, the scatter plot is computed with the computation region
resolution set to the resolutions of one of the rasters (which ideally
matches the other raster as well):

<div class="code"><pre>
g.region raster=lsat7_2002_30 -p
r.scatterplot input=lsat7_2002_30,lsat7_2002_40 output=scatterplot_full_res
</pre></div>

This best describes the actual state of the data, but unfortunately
this creates a lot of points which must be processed and rendered.
Therefore, it is also possible to compute the scatter plot in a lower
resolution by changing the computational region resolution:

<div class="code"><pre>
g.region raster=lsat7_2002_30 res=120 -p
r.scatterplot input=lsat7_2002_30,lsat7_2002_40 output=scatterplot_res_120
</pre></div>

Reducing the resolution creates a possibility of missing some outliers
or even smaller groups as some of the cells are just ignored, but
typically the general shape of the scatter plot is preserved.
In any case, with less points, every operation will by much faster.

<img src="r_scatterplot_density_res_240.png">
<p><em>
    Figure: Scatter plots computed with different computational region
    resolutions; first one is with full raster resolution (~30 m)
    second with resolution 120 m, and third with 240 m
</em></p>
</center>

Another way of dealing with hight density scatter plots
is to bin the points into cells of a rectangular grid.
Number of points per cells with influence color of the cell,
so the density will be expressed clearly.
The scatter plot can be computed in full resolution:

<div class="code"><pre>
g.region raster=lsat7_2002_30 -p
r.scatterplot input=lsat7_2002_30,lsat7_2002_40 output=scatterplot
</pre></div>

To create the grid the computation region extent should match
the scatter plot extent. The resolution determines the size of the grid
cells. 5 is a good size for data from 0 to 255.

<div class="code"><pre>
g.region vector=scatterplot res=5 -p
</pre></div>

The grid can be created using <em><a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/v.mkgrid.html">v.mkgrid</a></em>
module, the binning done using
<em><a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/v.vect.stats.html">v.vect.stats</a></em>, and finally the
color is set using <em><a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/v.colors.html">v.colors</a></em>.

<div class="code"><pre>
v.mkgrid map=scatterplot_grid
v.vect.stats points=scatterplot areas=scatterplot_grid count_column=count
v.colors map=scatterplot_grid use=attr column=count color=viridis
</pre></div>

The <em><a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/d.vect.html">d.vect</a></em> module picks up the color table
automatically, but it is advantageous to also specify that only
the grid cells with non-zero count of points should be displayed
using <tt>where="count > 0"</tt>:

<div class="code"><pre>
d.vect map=scatterplot_grid where="count > 0" icon=basic/point
</pre></div>

To get more interesting and sometimes smoother look, hexagonal
grid can be used:

<div class="code"><pre>
v.mkgrid -h map=scatterplot_grid
</pre></div>

Alternatively, a smaller cell size can be used. When the cell size
is the same as the distance between the points, like for example
using cells size 1 with integer rasters, the grid needs to be shifted
so that the points fall into the middle of the cells rather than
on the edges or corners. For these purposes the
<em><a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/g.region.html">g.region</a></em> accepts modifications of
the current extent values:

<div class="code"><pre>
g.region vector=scatterplot res=1 w=w-0.5 e=e+0.5 s=s-0.5 n=n+0.5
</pre></div>
