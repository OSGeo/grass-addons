NAME
     r.boxcount - Calculate fractal dimension by box counting.
     (GRASS Raster Program)

SYNOPSIS
     r.boxcount
     r.boxcount help
     r.boxcount [-gnot] input=name [output=name] k=value
     [resolution=value] [saturation=value]

DESCRIPTION
     r.boxcount calculates the box-counting (fractal) dimension
     of a binary raster map.  The program counts the minimum
     number of boxes, NbE, of size 1,...,1/2^k that are required
     to cover all non-zero cells.  It then uses this information
     to calculate the fractal dimension for each pair of box
     sizes.  The results may be saved in a text file, in which
     case they may also be displayed in graph form by invoking
     the program Gnuplot (which, athough not part of GRASS, is
     widely available on UNIX-like systems).

     r.boxcount also calculates the box-counting dimension by
     linear regression over a range of box sizes determined by
     the parameters resolution and saturation.	The largest box
     size that will be used is 1/resolution (i.e. this is the
     coarsest resolution).  The smallest box size is set to that
     for which the results satisfy the condition NbE &lt; saturation
     * the number of non-zero cells in the region (i.e. before
     saturation occurs).

OPTIONS
     The program can be run either non-interactively or
     interactively.  To run r.boxcount non-interactively, the
     user must specify at least an input file name and the value
     of k on the command line; any remaining parameters whose
     values are unspecified on the command line will be set to
     their default values (see below).

     To run the r.boxcount interactively the user should simply
     type r.boxcount on the command line, in which case the
     program will prompt for parameter values using the standard
     GRASS interface described in the manual entry for parser.


     Flags:

     -g		Create a file containing the commands for
		       Gnuplot to draw a graph of the results.
		       This file will be created in the current
		       working directory with the name
		       output.gnu.  This option requires that an
		       output filename has been provided.

     -n		Invoke Gnuplot to draw a graph of the
		       results now (i.e. automatically).  This
		       option requires the -g flag.

     -o		Silently overwrite the files output.dat
		       and output.gnu if they already exist in
		       the current working directory.

     -t		Provide only a terse description of the
		       results (i.e. provide no information about
		       progress and only display the fractal
		       dimension calculated by linear
		       regression).  This option applies to the
		       on-screen output only; it does not affect
		       that written to output.dat.

		       Parameters:

     input=name	The name of a raster map layer containing
		       binary values 0 or 1.

     output=name       Basename for the text file in which the
		       program output will be stored.  The file
		       name.dat is created in the user's current
		       working directory according to whether the
		       flag -o has been set.

     k=value	   The program calculates the box counting
		       dimension of the input map using box sizes
		       from 1,...,1/2^k.  Note that the current
		       region will be covered by 1 box of size 1,
		       4 of size 1/2, 16 of size 1/4, etc.  The
		       program automatically skips box sizes that
		       are smaller than the size of one map cell.

     resolution=name   Set the largest box size to 1/resolution
		       instead of 1.  Values of resolution must
		       be from the sequence 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32,
		       64, 128, 256,...
		       Default:	4

     saturation=value  Saturation is deemed to have occured when
		       NbE divided by the number of non-zero
		       cells in the map is >= saturation.
		       Default:	0.2

NON-INTERACTIVE PROGRAM USE
     The flag -n should not be used if the program is to be
     invoked from a shell script since Gnuplot will wait on the
     user pressing the RETURN key before exiting.

NOTES
     r.boxcount may give erroneous results if the current region
     is not square, i.e. the number of rows and columns are not
     equal.

     r.boxcount works in the current geographic region with the
     current mask.

     The last row of the table of results does not contain a
     value for the fractal dimension, D, because this can only be
     calculated for pairs of box sizes.	In the output file this
     missing value is replaced by the dummy value 99.999.  In
     both cases the recorded values of D always relate to the box
     sizes recorded in the given row and the following row.

     It is a good idea to examine the table and/or graph of
     results before accepting the fractal dimension calculated by
     linear regression based on the default values of resolution
     and saturation.  The user may find it helpful to study the
     results of applying r.boxcount to a theoretical fractal such
     as the Sierpinski Gasket.	r.rifs may be used to produce
     raster maps containing this and many other well known
     fractals.
