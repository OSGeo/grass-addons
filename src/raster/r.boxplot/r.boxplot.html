<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>
<em>r.boxplot</em> draws boxplots of the raster values of an input
raster map. The user has the option to define a zonal (categorical)
map. In that case, a boxplot will be drawn for each zone, using the
values of the input raster that fall within that zone.

<p>
If there is a zonal map, the user can add a line and band to
represent the median and interquartile range (IQR) of the input layer. Note
that all values of the input raster (within the region's extent)
are used to compute the median and IQR. If the zones of the zonal map
cover only part of the region, the user can mask out the non-covered 
parts of the input map first by means of <em>r.mask</em>. That will result in
an IQR and median representing the values that fall within the zones of
the zonal map only. Otherwise, the computational region can be changed to 
fit the extent of the zonal map with <em>g.region</em>

<p>
By default, the resulting plot is displayed on screen. However, the
user can also save the plot to file using the <b>output</b> option.
The format is determined by the extension given by the user. So, if
output = outputfile.png, the plot will be saved as a PNG file.

<p>
The whiskers extend to the most extreme data point, which is no
more than <b>range</b> &#10005; the IQR from the box. 
By default, a <b>range</b> of 1.5 is used, but the user can change
this. Note that range values need to be larger than 0.

<p>
By default, outliers are not included in the plot. Set the <b>o</b> flag
to include them in the plot. To also create a point vector map with the
locations of the outliers, the user needs to provide the name of the
output map using <b>map_outliers</b>.

<p>
There are a few layout options, including the option to rotate the
plot and the x-axis labels, print the boxplot(s) with notches, sort the
boxplot from low to high (ascending) or from high to low (descending)
median, color the boxplots according to the corresponding categories of
the zonal raster, set the type and color of the outliers, set the color
and width of the median line(s), set the color and transparency of the
raster's median line and IQR band, and set the width of the boxplots.


<h2>NOTE</h2>

The <em>r.boxplot</em> module operates on the raster array defined by the
current region settings, not the original extent and resolution of the
input map. See <a
href="https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/r.univar.html">g.region</a>
to understand the impact of the region settings on the calculations.

To include outliers, the function converts the raster
cell with outlier values to a point vector layer. This may take some
time if there are a lot of outliers. So, if users are working with very
large raster layers, they should be cautious to not set the <b>range</b> value
too low as that may result in a huge number of outliers.

<p>
The zonal map needs to be an integer map. If it is not, the function will exit
with the error message, 'The zonal raster must be of type CELL (integer)'.

<p>
If the <b>c</b> flag is used, the <b>bxp_color</b> and <b>median_color</b> 
are ignored, even if set by the user. The option to color boxploxs using the colors
of the zonal raster categories (<b>c</b> flag) only works if the zonal
map contains a color table. If it does not, the function exits with the
error message that 'The zonal map does not have a color table'. If the user 
thinks there is a color table, run <em>r.colors.out</em> and check if the
categories are integers. If not, that is the problem. If they are all
integers, you probably have caught a bug.

<p>
The module respects the mask (if set), and the region settings. This
means you can quickly change the area for which to create a boxplot by
simply changing the region and/or setting a (different) mask.

<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>

<h3>Example 1</h3>
Draw a boxplot of the values of the <i>elevation</i> layer from the
<a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/download/data/">NC sample
dataset</a>. Set the <b>h</b> flag to print the boxplot horizontally. 
Set the plot dimensions to 7 inch wide, 1 inch high.

<div class="code"><pre>
g.region raster=elevation
r.boxplot -h input=elevation plot_dimensions="7,1" output="r_boxplot_01.png"
</pre>
</div><br>

<p>
<img src="r_boxplot_01.png"><br>

<h3>Example 2</h3>
Draw boxplots of the values of the <i>elevation</i> layer per category from
the <i>landclass96</i> layer from the same
<a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/download/data/">NC sample
dataset</a>. Use the <b>r</b> flag to rotate the x-asis labels.

<div class="code"><pre>
r.boxplot -r input=elevation zone=landclass96 output="r_boxplot_02.png"
</pre>
</div><br>

<p>
<img src="r_boxplot_02.png"><br>

<h3>Example 3</h3>
Draw boxplots of the values of the <i>elevation</i> layer per category from
the <i>landclass96</i> layer from the same
<a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/download/data/">NC sample
dataset</a>. Set the <b>o</b> flag to include outliers. Use <b>bx_sort=ascending</b>
to order the boxplots from low to high median. Provide a name for the outlier
map to save the outlier locations as a point vector map.

<div class="code"><pre>
r.boxplot -o bx_sort=ascending input=elevation zones=landclass96 output="r_boxplot_03.png" map_outliers="outliers"
</pre>
</div><br>

<p>
<img src="r_boxplot_03.png"><br>

<p>
Below, part of the <i>landclass96</i> raster map is shown, with the vector point
layer with location of outliers on top. Curiously, for some lakes, only part of the
raster cells are outliers.</p>

<h3>Example 4</h3>
Draw boxplots of the values of the <i>elevation</i> layer per category from
the <i>landclass96</i> layer from the same
<a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/download/data/">NC sample
dataset</a>. Set the <b>c</b> flag to color the boxplots, use <b>bx_sort=ascending</b>
to order the boxplots from low to high median, and set the font size to 11.

<div class="code"><pre>
r.boxplot -c bx_sort=ascending fontsize=11 input=elevation zones=landclass96 output="r_boxplot_04.png"
</pre>
</div><br>

<h3>Example 5</h3>
To make it easier to compare the elevation distribution across the different
land classes, you can plot a line and band representing the
median and interquartile range of the whole raster layer.

<div class="code"><pre>
r.boxplot -c input=elevation zones=landclass96 raster_statistics=median,IQR
</pre>
</div><br>

<p>
Note, if the zones of your zonal map do not cover the entire area, you may want
to use <em>r.mask</em> to mask out the non-covered parts of the input map, or
alternatively, create a new input raster with only values within the zones
of the zonal layer.
