<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>
<em>r.boxplot</em> draws boxplots of the raster values of a input raster
layer. The user has the option to define a zonal (categorical) layer. In that
case, a boxplot will be drawn for each zone, using the values of the input
raster that fall within that zone.

<p>
By default, the resulting plot is displayed on screen. 
However, the user can also save the plot to file using the 
<em>output</em> option. The format is determined by the extension 
given by the user. So, if output = outputfile.png, the plot will 
be saved as a png file.

<p>
The whiskers extend to the most extreme data point, which is no more than
<i>range</i> &#10005; the interquartile range (iqr) from the box. By default,
a <i>range</i> of 1.5 is used, but the user can change this. Note that range
values need to be larger than 0.

<p>
By default, outliers are not included in the plot. Set to -o flag to include
them in the plot. To create a point layer with the locations of the outliers, 
the user needs to provide the name of the output map using <i>map_outliers</i>.

<p>
There are a few layout options, including the option to rotate 
the plot and the x-axis labels, print the boxplot(s) with notches and
sort the boxplot from low to high (ascending) or from high to low (descending)
median.

<p>
If the user opts to have the outliers drawn, a vector layer will be created
with the locations of the outliers. 

<h2>NOTE</h2>
To include outliers, the function converts the raster cell with outlier
values to a point vector layer. This may take some time if there are a
lot of outliers. So, if you are working with very large raster layers,
be cautious to not set the <i>range</i> value very low as that may result
in a very large number of outliers. 

<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>

<h3>Example 1</h3>
Draw a boxplot of the values of the <em>elevation</em> layer from the  
<a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/download/data/">NC sample 
dataset</a>. Set the -h flag to print the boxplot horizontally.

<div class="code"><pre>
g.region raster=elevation
r.boxplot -h input=elevation
</pre>
</div>

<h3>Example 2</h3>
Draw boxplots of the values of the <em>elevation</em> layer per category from
the land use map from the same 
<a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/download/data/">NC sample 
dataset</a>. Use the -r flag to rotate the x-asis labels.

<div class="code"><pre>
r.boxplot -r input=elevation zones=landuse output="r_boxplot_02.png"
</pre>
</div>

<h3>Example 3</h3>
Draw boxplots of the values of the <em>elevation</em> layer per category from
the land use map from the same 
<a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/download/data/">NC sample 
dataset</a>. Set the -o flag to include outliers. Use order=ascending 
to order the boxplots from low to high median.

<div class="code"><pre>
r.boxplot -o order=ascending input=elevation zones=landuse output="r_boxplot_03.png"
</pre>
</div>

<h3>Example 4</h3>
Draw boxplots of the values of the <em>elevation</em> layer per category from
the land use map from the same 
<a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/download/data/">NC sample 
dataset</a>. Set the -o flag to include outliers. Use order=ascending 
to order the boxplots from low to high median. Provide a name for the outlier 
map to save the outlier locations as a point layer.

<div class="code"><pre>
r.boxplot -o order=ascending input=elevation zones=landuse map_outliers="outliers"
</pre>
</div>
