<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
Module <em>r.futures.calibration</em> is part of <a href="r.futures.html">FUTURES</a>,
land change model.
It is used for calibrating certain input variables for patch growing
algorithm <em>r.futures.pga</em>, specifically patch size and compactness parameters.
The calibration process is conducted to match observed urban growth patterns
to those simulated by the model, including the sizes and shapes of new development.
The calibration is achieved by varying the values of the patch parameters,
comparing the distribution of simulated patch sizes to those observed
for the reference period, and choosing the values that provide the closest match.
For the details about calibration see below.

<p>
This module depends on addon
<a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/grass7/manuals/addons/r.object.geometry.html">r.object.geometry</a>.

<h3>Patch size</h3>
As part of the calibration process, module <em>r.futures.calibration</em>
produces patch size distribution file specified in <b>patch_sizes</b> parameter,
which contains sizes (in cells) of all new patches observed
in the reference period. The format of this file is one patch size per line.
If flag <b>-s</b> is used, patch sizes will be analyzed per each subregion,
and written as a CSV file with columns representing patch library for each
subregion and header containing
the categories of subregions.
FUTURES uses this file to determine the size of the simulated patches.
Often the length of the reference time period does not match
the time period which we are trying to simulate.
We use the <b>discount factor</b> to alter the size of simulated patches
so that after the reference period they closely match the observed patterns.
During the simulation, this factor is multiplied by the patch sizes listed in the patch size file.
The values of <b>discount factor</b> can vary between 0 and 1,
for example value 0.6 was used by Meentemeyer et al. 2013.

<h3>Patch compactness</h3>
The shapes of patches simulated by FUTURES are governed
by the patch compactness parameter (Meentemeyer et al. 2013, Eq. 1).
This variable doesn't represent actual patch compactness, it is rather
an adjustable scaling factor that controls patch compactness
through a distance decay effect.
By specifying the mean and range of this parameter in module
<em>r.futures.pga</em>, we allow for variation in patch shape.
As the value of the parameter increases, patches become more compact.
Calibration is achieved by varying the values specified in <b>compactness_mean</b>
and <b>compactness_range</b> and comparing the distribution
of the simulated patch compactness (computed as
<em>patch perimeter / (2 * sqrt(pi * area))</em>)
to those observed for the reference period.
Meentemeyer et al. 2013 used mean 0.4 and range 0.08.

<h3>Calibration input and output</h3>
Calibration requires the development binary raster in the beginning
and end of the reference period (<b>development_start</b> and <b>development_end</b>)
to derive the patch sizes and compactness.
It is possible to set the minimum number of cells of a patch in <b>patch_threshold</b>
to ignore too small patches.
For each combination of values provided in <b>compactness_mean</b>,
<b>compactness_range</b> and <b>discount_factor</b>, it runs
module <em>r.futures.pga</em> which creates new development pattern.
From this new simulated development, patch characteristics are derived
and compared with the observed characteristics by histogram comparison
and an error (histogram distance) is computed.
Since <em>r.futures.pga</em> is a stochastic module, multiple
runs (specified in <b>repeat</b>) are recommended, the error is then averaged.
Calibration results are saved in a CSV file specified in <b>calibration_results</b>:

<pre>
discount_factor,compactness_mean,compactness_range,area_error,compactness_error,combined_error
0.10,0.60,0.10,0.92,0.70,0.81
0.10,0.80,0.10,0.92,0.76,0.84
0.10,0.20,0.10,0.93,0.78,0.85
0.10,0.50,0.10,0.89,0.82,0.86
0.10,1.00,0.10,0.94,0.84,0.89
0.10,0.90,0.10,0.92,0.86,0.89
0.10,0.70,0.10,0.96,0.83,0.90
0.10,0.10,0.10,1.00,1.00,1.00

</pre>

The first three columns represent the combination of calibrated parameters.
The last column is the average of the normalized area and compactness errors
for each combination. The first line shows the combination with lowest error.
<p>
Providing too many values in <b>compactness_mean</b>,
<b>compactness_range</b> and <b>discount_factor</b> results in very long computation.
Therefore it is recommended to run <em>r.futures.calibration</em>
on high-end computers, with more processes running in parallel using <b>nprocs</b> parameter.
Also, it can be run on smaller regions, under the assumption
that patch sizes and shapes are close to being consistent across the entire study area.

<p>
For all other parameters not mentioned above, please refer to
<em>r.futures.pga</em> documentation.
