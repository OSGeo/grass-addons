<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.flowaccumulation</em> calculates flow accumulation from a flow direction
raster map using the Memory-Efficient Flow Accumulation (MEFA) parallel
algorithm by Cho (2023).

<h2>NOTES</h2>

Unlike <em>r.watershed</em>, but just like <em>r.accumulate</em>,
<em>r.flowaccumulation</em> does not require elevation data to calculate flow
accumulation. Instead, this module only uses a flow direction raster map to
trace and accumulate the amount of flow draining through and including each
cell.

<p>The module recognizes three different formats of flow directions:

<img src="r_flowaccumulation_formats.png" alt="degree">
</div>

<p>Because it does not use elevation data (e.g., slope), flow accumulation is
calculated by single flow direction (SFD) routing and may not be comparable to
the result from multiple flow direction (MFD) routing.

<p>By default, the module allows cell values to overflow the maximum value of
the specified output <b>type</b> to avoid excessive checks. With the <b>-o</b>
flag, it prints a fatal error and exits if an overflow occurs.

<p>The module uses extra memory to store an intermediate output matrix and it
is generally faster than with the <b>-m</b> flag because intermediate results
need not be calculated repeatedly. On heavy swapping, however, computation can
be faster with the <b>-m</b> flag because of reduced memory allocation. With
this flag, intermediate results are calculated as needed and never stored in
memory.

<p>Cells in the output matrix are initialized to null and need not be nullified
after computation. With the <b>-z</b> flag, they are initialized to zero and
those outside flow accumulation are nullified later. With this flag, it can be
faster on heavy swapping because of less write operations for nullifying
remaining zero cells outside flow accumulation, compared to null-initialization
of the entire region without this flag. However, when there is not much
swapping (e.g., data fit in the physical memory), the <b>-z</b> flag can be
slower with additional zero-comparison operations. The <b>-Z</b> flag is
similar to the <b>-z</b> flag, but zero cells are not nullified and are saved
in the output map.

<p>Weighted flow accumulation can be computed using a <b>weight</b> raster map.
When this option is given, its raster type is used for flow accumulation, and
the <b>type</b> option, <b>-o</b>, <b>-z</b>, and <b>-Z</b> flags cannot be
specified.

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

These examples use the North Carolina sample dataset.

<p>Calculate flow accumulation using <em>r.watershed</em> and
<em>r.flowaccumulation</em>:
<div class="code"><pre>
# set computational region
g.region -p raster=elevation

# calculate positive flow accumulation and drainage directions using r.watershed
# for comparison, use -s (SFD)
r.watershed -sa elevation=elevation accumulation=flow_accum drainage=drain_directions

# calculate flow accumulation using r.flowaccumulation
r.flowaccumulation input=drain_directions output=flow_accum_new

# copy color table
r.colors map=flow_accum_new raster=flow_accum

# check difference between flow_accum and flow_accum_new
r.mapcalc expression="flow_accum_diff=if(flow_accum-flow_accum_new, flow_accum-flow_accum_new, null())"
</pre></div>

<p>There are slight differences between the two output maps. The yellow and
purple cells show the difference raster map (<i>flow_accum_diff</i>). The red
arrows and numbers represent drainage directions (<i>drain_directions</i>) and
flow accumulation by <em>r.watershed</em> (<i>flow_accum</i>), respectively.
Note that some cells close to headwater cells are assigned 1 even though they
are located downstream of other cells.

<p>For comparison, these numbers show the new flow accumulation by
<em>r.flowaccumulation</em> (<i>flow_accum_new</i>). The same cells are
properly accumulated from the headwater cells.
