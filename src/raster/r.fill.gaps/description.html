<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>


<em><b>r.fill.gaps</b></em> - Fast gap filling and interpolation of dense raster data.

<p>

The <em>r.fill.gaps</em> module is capable of quickly filling small "no data" areas (gaps) in large raster maps.
As a rule of thumb, there should be at least as many data cells as there are "no data" cells in
the input raster map. Several interpolation modes are available.
By default, all values of the input raster map will be replaced with locally interpolated values in the output raster map.
With dense data and small gaps, this should result in only slight deviations from the original data
and produce smooth output. Alternatively, setting the <em>-p</em> flag will preserve the original cell values.

<p>

Available gap filling modes:
<ul>
<li>spatially weighted mean (default)</li>
<li>simple mean</li>
<li>simple median</li>
<li>simple mode</li>
</ul>

<p>

The spatially weighted mean is equivalent to an Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW; see
also <em><a href="r.surf.idw.html">r.surf.idw</a></em>) interpolation. The simple
mean is equivalent to a low-pass filter. Median and mode replacements can also be
achieved using <em><a href="r.neighbors.html">r.neighbors</a></em>.
 
<p> 

Note that <em>r.fill.gaps</em> is highly optimized for fast processing of large raster datasets
with a small interpolation distance threshold (i.e. closing small gaps). As a trade-off
for speed and a small memory foot print, some spatial accuracy is lost due to the rounding
of the distance threshold to the closest approximation in input raster cells and the use of a matrix of precomputed weights at cell resolution (see further
down for details). Note also that processing time will increase exponentially with higher distance settings.
Cells outside the distance threshold will not be interpolated, preserving the edges of the data zones in the input data.

<p>

This module is not well suited for interpolating sparse input data and closing large gaps.
For such purposes solutions more appropriate methods are available, such as <em><a href="v.surf.idw.html">v.surf.idw</a></em>
or <em><a href="v.surf.rst.html">v.surf.rst</a></em>.

<p>

Applications where the properties of <em>r.fill.gaps</em> are advantageous include the processing of
high resolution, close range scanning and remote sensing datasets. Such datasets commonly feature densely spaced
measurements that have some gaps after rasterization, due to blind spots, instrument failures,
and misalignments between the GIS' raster cell grids and the original measurement locations.
In these cases, <em>r.fill.gaps</em> should typically be run using the "weighted mean" (default) method
and with a small distance setting (the default is to use a search radius of just three cells).

<p>

The images below show a gradiometer dataset with gaps and its interpolated equivalent, produced using
the spatially weighted mean operator (<em>mode="wmean"</em>).

<p>

In addition, <em>r.fill.gaps</em> can be useful for raster map generalization. Often, this involves removing small 
clumps of categorized cells and then filling the resulting data gaps without "inventing" any new values.
In such cases, the "mode" or "median" interpolators should be used.


<h2>USAGE</h2>

The most critical user-provided settings are the interpolation/gap filling method (<em>mode=</em>)
and the maximum distance, up to which <em>r.fill.gaps</em> will scan for given data points
when attempting to fill/interpolate a value at any given location (<em>distance=</em>).
The distance can be expressed as a number of cells (default) or in the current location's units (if the <em>-m</em> flag is given).
The latter are typically meters, but can be any other units of a <em>planar</em> coordinate system. 

<p>

Note that proper handling of geodetic coordinates (lat/lon) and distances is currently not implemented.
For lat/lon data, the distance should therefore be specified in cells and usage of <em>r.fill.gaps</em> should
be restricted to small areas to avoid large inaccuracies that may arise from the different extents of cells
along the latitudinal and longitudinal axes.

<p>

Distances specfied in map units will be approximated as accurately as the current region's cell resolution
settings allow. The program will warn if the distance cannot be expressed as whole
cells at the current region's resolution. In such case, the number of cells in the search window
will be rounded up. Due to the rounding effect introduced by using cells as spatial units,
the actual maximum distance considered by the interpolation may be up to half a cell diagonal 
larger than the one specified by the user.

<p>

The interpolator type "wmean" uses a pre-computed matrix of spatial weights To speed up computation. This matrix can
be examined (printed to the screen) before running the interpolation, by setting the <em>-w</em> flag.
In mode "wmean", the <em>power=</em> option has the usual meaning: higher values mean
that cell values in the neighborhood lose their influence on the cell to be interpolated more rapidly with increasing distance from the latter.
Another way of explaining this effect is to state that larger "power" settings result in more
localized interpolation, smaller ones in more globalized interpolation. The default setting is <em>power=2.0</em>.

<p>

The interpolators "mean", "median" and "mode" are calculated from all cell values 
within the search radius. No spatial weighting is applied for these methods.
The "mode" of the input data may not always be unique. In such case, the mode will be the smallest 
value with the highest frequency.

<p>

Often, input data will contain spurious extreme measurements (spikes, outliers, noise) caused by the limits
of device sensitivity, hardware defects, environmental influences, etc. If the normal, valid
range of input data is known beforehand, then the <em>minimum=</em> and <em>maximum=</em> options can be used
to exclude those input cells that have values below or above that range, respectively.
This will prevent the influence of spikes and outliers from spreading through the interpolation.

<p>

Unless the <em>-p</em> (replace) flag is given, data cells of the input map will be replaced
with interpolated values instead of preserving them in the output.

Besides the result of the interpolation/gap filling, a second output map can be specified via the
<em>uncertainty=</em> option. The cell values in this map represent a simple measure of how
much uncertainty was involved in interpolating each cell value of the primary output map, with
"0" being the lowest and "1" being the theoretic highest uncertainty. Uncertainty is measured
by summing up all cells in the neighborhood (defined by the search radius <em>distance=</em>) that contain a value in the <em>input</em> map,
multiplied by their weights, and dividing the result by the sum of all weights in the neighborhood.
For <em>mode=wmean</em>, this means that interpolated output cells that
were computed from many nearby input cells have very low uncertainty and vice versa.
For all other modes, all weights in the neighborhood are constant "1" and the uncertainty measure
is a simple measure of how many input data cells were present in the search window.


<h2>NOTES</h2>

The key to getting good gap filling results is to understand the spatial weighting scheme
used in mode "wmean". The weights are precomputed and assigned per cell within the search
window centered on the location at which to interpolate/gap fill all cells within
the user-specified distance.

<p>

The illustration below shows the precomputed weights matrix for a search distance of four cells from the center cell:

<pre>

000.00 000.01 000.04 000.07 000.09 000.07 000.04 000.01 000.00 
000.01 000.06 000.13 000.19 000.22 000.19 000.13 000.06 000.01 
000.04 000.13 000.25 000.37 000.42 000.37 000.25 000.13 000.04 
000.07 000.19 000.37 000.56 000.68 000.56 000.37 000.19 000.07 
000.09 000.22 000.42 000.68 001.00 000.68 000.42 000.22 000.09 
000.07 000.19 000.37 000.56 000.68 000.56 000.37 000.19 000.07 
000.04 000.13 000.25 000.37 000.42 000.37 000.25 000.13 000.04 
000.01 000.06 000.13 000.19 000.22 000.19 000.13 000.06 000.01 
000.00 000.01 000.04 000.07 000.09 000.07 000.04 000.01 000.00

</pre>

Note that the weights in such a small window drop rapidly for the default setting of <em>power=2</em>.

<p>

If the distance is given in map units (flag <em>-m</em>), then the search window can be modeled more accurately as a circle.
The illustration below shows the precomputed weights for a distance in map units that is approximately equivalent to four cells from the center cell:

<pre>

...... 000.00 000.02 000.06 000.09 000.06 000.02 000.00 ......

</pre>

<p>

When using a small search radius, <em>cells=</em> must also be set to a small value. Otherwise, there may not be enough cells with data within
the search radius to support interpolation.    

<p>

This module can handle cells with different X and Y resolutions. However, note that the weight matrix
will be skewed in such cases, with higher weights occurring close to the center and along the axis with the higher resolution.
This is because weights on the lower resolution axis are less accurately calculated.
The skewing effect will be stronger if the difference between the X and Y axis resolution  is greater and a larger "power" setting is chosen.
This property of the weights matrix directly reflects the higher information density along the higher resolution axis.

<p>

Note on printing the weights matrix (using the <em>-w</em> flag): the matrix cannot be printed if it is too large.

<p>

The memory estimate provided by the <em>-m</em> flag is a lower limit on the amount of RAM that will be needed.

<p>

If the <em>-s</em> flag is set, floating point type output will be saved as a "single precision" raster map, saving ~50% disk space compared to the default "double precision" output.


<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

Gap-fill a dataset using spatially weighted mean (IDW) and a maximum search radius of 3.0 map units;
also produce uncertainty estimation map:

<pre>
r.fill.gaps input=measurements output=result dist=3.0 -m mode=wmean uncertainty=uncert_map
</pre>

Run a fast low-pass filter (replacement all cells with mean value of neighboring cells) on the input map:
<pre>
r.fill.gaps input=measurements output=result dist=10 mode=mean
</pre>

Fill data gaps in a categorized raster map; preserve existing data: 
<pre>
r.fill.gaps input=categories output=result dist=100 -m mode=mode -p
</pre>

<h2>CAVEATS</h2>

The straight-line metric used for converting distances in map units to cell numbers is only adequate for planar coordinate systems.
Using this module with lat/lon input data will likely give inaccurate results, especially when interpolating over large geographical areas.

<p>

If the distance is set to a relatively large value, processing time
will quickly approach and eventually exceed that of point-based interpolation modules such
as <em><a href="v.surf.rst.html">v.surf.rst</a></em>.
