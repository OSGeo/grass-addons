<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

r.connectivity.network is the 2nd tool of the r.connectivity.* tool-set and 
performs network analysis (using the igraph-package in R). It requires a network 
dataset produced with r.connectivity.distance, and conducts analysis on the graph, 
edge and vertex level.

<p>The analysis is based on a negative exponential decay kernel (as described 
e.g. in Bunn et al. (2000), which characterizes the probability of dispersal 
over increasing cost distance. The user can modify the function and thus 
form of the kernel according to the dispersal characteristics of her/his 
species or habitat type. Form of the curve can be controlled with the <b>base</b> 
and <b>exponent</b> options. The resulting kernel can be visually inspected 
using the <b>x-flag</b>. If the <b>kernel_plot</b> option is given a plot 
of the kernel is saved in the format depending on the ending of the file name 
defined by the user.</p>

If an overview plot is requested in the <em>overview</em> option, 
network characteristics are visualised in a plot showing an overview over:
<ul>
<li>the number of connections,</li>
<li>the number of components (clusters) and</li>
<li>the size of the largest network component within the network</li>
</ul>
over increasing cost-distance between patches.

<h3>Output column names</h3>

Due to limitations in dbf, the length of field names is limited to ten signs. 
Thus, names of the edge and vertex measures are abbreviated in the vector 
attribute table. This was (mostly) done using the following pattern for 
column names (of vertex and edge measures):
<dl>
	<dd>weight _ measure _ (sub)graph</dd>
</dl>

<h3>(Sub)Graphs</h3>
In r.connectivity.network a graph is built from the network dataset produced 
in r.connectivity.distance. From this full and directed graph a set of 
(sub)graphs is extracted, specified by:
<ul>
<li>u = for the undirected graph</li>
<li>d = for the graph with only direct edges</li>
<li>c = for the graph with only edges shorter than the cost distance threshold</li>
</ul>

<h3>Graph measures</h3>

<dl>

<dd><b>Number of edges</b></dd>
<dd>The number of edges is the number of connections between pairs of vertices 
in the network.</dd>

<dd><b>Number of vertices</b></dd>
<dd>The number of vertices is the number of polygons (patches) from the input 
vector map which are analysed in the r.connectivity.*.</dd>

<dd><b>Cluster</b></dd>
<dd> A cluster is a group of vertices which are connected with each other, but 
not with the rest of vertices in a graph (a single isolated vertex can be a 
cluster as well).</dd>

<dd><b>Diameter</b></dd>
<dd>The diameter of a graph is the length of the longest geodesic.</dd>

<dd><b>Density</b></dd>
<dd>The density of a graph is the ratio of the number of edges and the number 
of possible edges.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Edge measures</h3>
<dl>
<dt><b>Input parameters</b></dt>
<dd><b>con_id</b> = ID of the directed connection between two vertices (edge)</dd>
<dd><b>con_id_u</b> = ID of the undirected connection between two vertices (edge)</dd>
<dd><b>from_p</b> = Patch ID (patch_id) of the start-vertex of an (directed) edge</dd>
<dd><b>from_pop</b> = Population proxy (pop_proxy) of the start-vertex of an (directed) edge</dd>
<dd><b>to_p</b> = Patch ID (patch_id) of the end-vertex of an (directed) edge</dd>
<dd><b>to_pop</b> = Population proxy (pop_proxy) of the end-vertex of an (directed) edge<br><br>
</dd>


<dt><b>Weights</b></dt>

<dd><b>Cost distance (cd)</b></dd>
<dd>Cost distance is calculated for the directed (cd) and undirected graph (cd_u). 
The cd weight for directed edges is exactly like measured in r.connectivity.distance, 
the cd weight for undirected edges is the average cost distance of the two directed edges 
between a pair of vertices (mean( a--b, b-a)). The cost distance weight does not take the 
user defined dispersal information (the population proxy for the different patches and 
the dispersal kernel) into account.</dd>

<dd><b>Negative exponential decay kernel flow (distk)</b></dd>
<dd>The negative exponential decay kernel is defined by the variables <em>euler</em>, 
<em>base</em>, and <em>exponent</em> specified by the user. It is calculated for the 
directed (distk) and undirected edges(distk_u) using the following formulas:</dd>
<dd><em>distk = euler ^ ( ( basis * ( 10 ^ exponent ) )*( cd))</em></dd>
<dd><em>distk_u = euler ^ ( ( basis * ( 10 ^ exponent ) )*( cd_u))</em></dd>

<dd><b>Maximum potential flow (mf)</b></dd>
<dd>For the maximum potential flow (mf) weight the user defined dispersal information 
(the population proxy and the dispersal kernel) is used to model the flow of propagules 
between a pair of vertices. This weight is based on the assumption that propagules disperse 
evenly and in full amount into all surrounding patches. Maximum potential flow is 
calculated using the following formula:</dd>
<dd>mf = disk * pop_proxy</dd>
<dd>Maximum potential flow is calculated for the directed graph as incoming (mf_i) and 
outgoing (mf_o) flow as well as for the undirected graph (mf_u). Unlike the cost distance 
weight, mf represents the "closeness" of a pair of vertices. For some (most) algorithms it 
had to be inverted in order to give meaningful results (mf_inv = Inverted maximum potential 
flow for directed edges, mf_inv_u = Inverted maximum potential flow for undirected edges).</dd>

<dd><b>Competing potential flow (cf)</b></dd>
<dd>The competing potential flow (cf) weight is based on the work by Ranius & Roberge 2011. 
Like in the maximum potential flow (mf) weight, the user defined dispersal information 
(the population proxy and the negative exponential decay kernel) is used to model the flow 
of propagules between a pair of vertices. But here it is assumed that the total amount 
of propagules is limited to the population proxy given by the user, and that this amount 
is distributed according to the "attractiveness" (defined by population size and cost 
distance) of the surrounding patches.</dd>
<dd>Competing potential flow is calculated for the directed (cf) and undirected (cf_u) 
graph. Unlike the cost distance weight, cf represents the "closeness" between a pair 
of vertices. For some (most) algorithms it had to be inverted in order to give meaningful 
results (cf_inv = Inverted competing potential flow for directed edges, cf_inv_u = 
Inverted competing potential flow for undirected edges).<br><br></dd>

<dd>The mf and cf weights are inverted (mf_inv, cf_inv) by multiplying them with -1 
followed by linear normalising to the original maximum and minimum values.<br><br></dd>



<dt><b>Output parameters</b></dt>

<dd><b>Shortest connections (isshort)</b></dd>
<dd>In r.connectivity.network all edges are classified if they represent the 
shortest path from the start- to the end-vertex, which is stored as a logical 
value (0 = FALSE or 1 = TRUE). Shortest connections are identified for every 
weight (isshort_cd, isshort_mf, isshort_cf). Finally the isshort attribute 
is set to 1 if an edge represents the shortest path for either the cd-weight, 
the mf-weight or the cf-weight (or 0 otherwise).</dd>

<dd><b>Biconnected components (bc)</b></dd>
<dd>If the removal of a single vertex and its adjacent edges does not disconnect 
the graph (increase the number of clusters) it is part of a biconnected component.</dd>

<dd><b>Bridges (is_br)</b></dd>
<dd>A bridge is an edge whose removal increases the number of clusters in a graph. 
Edges are classified either as bridge (1) or not (0).</dd>

<dd><b>Edge betweenness (eb)</b></dd>
<dd>The edge betweenness (eb) value represents the number of shortest paths that go 
through an edge, considering the shortest paths between all possible pairs of vertices. 
Edge betweenness is calculated with all three weights for the entire directed graph 
(cd_eb_u, mf_eb_u, cf_eb_u), the undirected graph with only direct edges (cd_eb_ud, 
mf_eb_ud, cf_eb_ud), and the undirected graph with only direct edges shorter than cost 
distance threshold (cd_eb_udc, mf_eb_udc, cf_eb_udc).</dd>

<dd><b>Local edge betweenness (leb)</b></dd>
<dd>The local edge betweenness (leb) value represents the number of shortest paths
 that go through an edge, considering the shortest paths between all possible 
 pairs of vertices which are shorter than the user defined local 
 neighbourhood (lnbh_threshold). Local edge betweenness is calculated with all 
 three weights for the entire directed graph (cd_leb_u, mf_leb_u, cf_leb_u), 
 the undirected graph with only direct edges (cd_leb_ud, mf_leb_ud, cf_leb_ud), 
 and the undirected graph with only direct edges shorter than cost distance 
 threshold (cd_leb_udc, mf_leb_udc, cf_leb_udc).</dd>

<dd><b>Edge betweenness community (ebc)</b></dd>
<dd>Some groups of vertices can be densely connected with each other but only 
little connected to other vertices. Such groups of relative intense connected 
vertices are communities. One algorithm to identify communities in a graph is 
edge betweenness community (ebc). Edge betweenness community is calculated 
in an iterative loop, where, first edge betweenness is calculated, then the 
edge with the largest edge betweenness value is removed, edge betweenness is 
recalculated and so on. The algorithm produces mainly two edge measures:</dd>
<dd>1. the order in which edges were deleted (ebc_r)</dd>
<dd>2. the edge betweenness value of an edge at the time of removal</dd>

<dd>For large graphs calculating edge betweenness community can take a long time. 
Therefore, it is only calculated on request (y-flag) and only for one weight (cf). 
It is only calculated for the entire (undirected) graph.</dd>

<dd><b>Minimum spanning trees (mst)</b></dd>
<dd>A minimum spanning tree (mst) is a subgraph consisting of the minimal possible 
number of edges  (= number of vertices - 1) connecting all vertices to a minimal 
possible number of clusters, while the sum of all edge weights is minimised. 
If the graph consists of more than one cluster, the result of the minimum spanning 
tree algorithm is a so-called minimum spanning forest, consisting of the minimum 
spanning tree for each cluster. In the context of nature conservation, the minimum 
spanning tree is sometimes referred to as the "backbone" of an area network 
(Bunn etal. 2000). In r.connectivity.network the minimum spanning tree/forest 
is calculated with all weights (cd, mf, cf) and for all undirected (sub)graphs 
(u, ud, udc) resulting in the following (logical) edge measures: 
cd_mst_u, cd_mst_ud, cd_mst_udc, mf_mst_u, mf_mst_ud, mf_mst_udc, 
cf_mst_u, cf_mst_ud, cf_mst_udc, where edges are either part of the minimum 
spanning tree/forest (1) or not (0).</dd>

<dd><b>Potential cluster connectors (cl_pc_u)</b></dd>
<dd>A cluster is a group of vertices which are connected with each other, but
 not with the rest of vertices in a graph (a single isolated vertex can be a 
cluster as well). Potential cluster connectors are edges which are longer 
than the connectivity threshold, and connect clusters in the subgraph with 
only edges shorter than the connectivity threshold.</dd>

<dd><b>Potential community connectors (cf_ebc_pc, cf_iebc_pc)</b></dd>
<dd>Potential community connectors are edges which connect communities identified 
by the edge betweenness community algorithm for a user defined community level.</dd>

<h2>Vertex measures</h2>
<dl>
<dt><b>Input parameters</b></dt>
<dd><b>Patch ID (patch_id)</b></dd>
<dd>ID of the vertex = category value (cat) of the patch vector given by the user 
in r.connectivity.distance.</dd>

<dd><b>Population proxy (pop_proxy)</b></dd>
<dd>The population proxy given by the user in r.connectivity.distance.</dd>

<dt><b>Output parameters</b></dt>
<dd><b>Cluster membership (cl)</b></dd>
<dd>A cluster is a group of vertices which are connected with each other, 
but not with the rest of vertices in a graph (a single isolated vertex is a 
cluster as well). The cluster membership value (integer) is the id of the 
cluster a vertex belongs to.

<dd><b>Community structure and membership (cf_(i)ebc_cs, cf_(i)ebc_cl)</b></dd>
<dd>The edge betweenness community algorithm is used to analyse the community 
structure of a graph. It results in a hierarchical structure which describes 
how a graph is split up by the edge removal process into an increasing number 
of communities. The hierarchical community structure is stored as the 
(character) vertex attribute "cf_ebc_cs". The community membership value 
(integer) is the id of the community (identified by edge betweenness community) 
a vertex belongs to (on a user defined level of community division).</dd>

<dd><b>Articulation points (art_p)</b></dd>
<dd>Articulation points (art_p) are vertices whose removal would increase 
the number of clusters in a graph. Articulation points are identified for 
the entire directed graph (art_p_u), the undirected graph with only direct 
edges (art_p_ud), and the undirected graph with only direct edges shorter 
than the cost distance threshold (art_p_udc). Articulation points (art_p) are a 
(logical) measure of the graph structure and do not take edge weights into 
account. Vertices are either articulation points (1) or not (0).</dd>

<dd><b>Articulation (art)</b></dd>
<dd>The articulation value (integer) (art) is the number of new clusters which 
would occur when a vertex is removed. The articulation value (art) is a measure 
of the graph structure and does not take edge weights into account.</dd>

<dd><b>Degree centrality (deg)</b></dd>
<dd>Degree centrality of a vertex is defined as the number of vertices connected 
to this vertex. This (integer) measure is a measure of the graph structure and 
does not take edge weights into account. Degree centrality is calculated for 
all three undirected graphs (deg_u, deg_ud, deg_udc).</dd>

<dd><b>Eigenvector centrality (evc)</b></dd>
<dd>Eigenvector centrality (evc) in r.connectivity.network is a variation of the 
eigenvector centrality algorithm provided by the igraph library (see also: Csardi 
& Nepusz 2006). In r.connectivity.network eigenvector centrality is the sum of 
incoming potential flow of a vertex.</dd>

<dd>Because eigenvector centrality takes the direction of potential flows into 
account it is calculated only for the directed graph and the directed graph with 
only edges shorter than connectivity threshold, using both cf and mf weight 
(cf_evc_u, cf_evc_uc, mf_evc_u, mf_evc_uc). Eigenvector centrality is stored 
with double precision.</dd>


<dd><b>Closeness centrality (cl)</b></dd>
<dd>Closeness centrality represents the number of steps which are necessary 
to access every other vertex from a given vertex. Closeness centrality 
(integer) is calculated with all three weights for the entire directed 
graph (cd_cl_u, mf_cl_u, cf_cl_u), the undirected graph with only direct 
edges (cd_cl_ud, mf_cl_ud, cf_cl_ud), and the undirected graph with only 
direct edges shorter than cost distance threshold 
(cd_cl_udc, mf_cl_udc, cf_cl_udc).</dd>

<dd><b>Vertex betweenness (vb)</b></dd>
<dd>The vertex betweenness (vb) value represents the number of shortest paths 
that go through a vertex (but that do not start or end in that vertex), 
considering the shortest paths between all possible pairs of vertices. 
Vertex betweenness is calculated with all three weights for the entire 
directed graph (cd_vb_u, mf_vb_u, cf_vb_u), the undirected graph with 
only direct edges  (cd_vb_ud, mf_vb_ud, cf_vb_ud), and the undirected 
graph with only direct edges shorter than cost distance threshold 
(cd_vb_udc, mf_vb_udc, cf_vb_udc).</dd>

<dd><b>Local vertex betweenness (lvb)</b></dd>
<dd>The local vertex betweenness (lvb) value represents the number of shortest 
paths that go through a vertex (but that do not start or end in that vertex), 
considering the shortest paths between all possible pairs of vertices which are 
shorter than the user defined local neighbourhood (lnbh_threshold). Local vertex 
betweenness is calculated with all three weights for the entire directed graph 
(cd_vb_u, mf_vb_u, cf_vb_u), the undirected graph with only direct edges 
(cd_vb_ud, mf_vb_ud, cf_vb_ud), and the undirected graph with only direct edges 
shorter than cost distance threshold (cd_vb_udc, mf_vb_udc, cf_vb_udc).</dd>

<dd><b>Neighbourhood size (nbh_s)</b></dd>
<dd>The neighbourhood size (nbh_s) is the number of other vertices which 
can be reached from a vertex.</dd>

<dd><b>Local neighbourhood size (nbh_sl)</b></dd>
<dd>The local neighbourhood size (nbh_sl) is the number of other vertices 
which can be reached from a vertex along a path which is shorter than the 
user defined local neighbourhood.</dd>

<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>

<em>The following example is based on the North Carolina dataset 
and continued from the example in r.connectivity.distance.</em><br>

<h3>Analyse the network</h3>
(r.connectivity.network)
In the next step network analysis is performed. We define the connectivity 
cutoff (maximum cost distance where connectivity is assumed) to be 1500.0 
cost distance units, which represents the maximum known dispersal ability 
of our species. The dispersal kernel is adjusted to characteristics of this 
species by setting the exponent to -3, which gives a steeper decrease in 
successful dispersal with increasing cost distance. Only very few dispersal 
units of our species are expected to cross more than ca. 900 cost distance 
units successfully (see: ./hws_connectivity/kernel.eps after running the 
command or run it with the x-flag (-x) for only displaying the kernel).<br> 
Connectivity metrics results are stored in the attribute table of the 
vector maps on vertex (patches, map name: "prefix" _ vertex_measures) 
and edge level (connections, map name: "prefix" _ edge_measures). 
An overview over connectivity metrics on the graph level (the entire network) 
is stored in "folder" (./hws_connectivity). We requested also an R-plot of 
the dispersal kernel and an R-plot giving an overview over network 
characteristics to be stored in the same folder.

<p>Users with a multi-processor computer (e.g. dual-core) may speed up processing 
by setting cores > 1 in r.connectivity.network.</p>
