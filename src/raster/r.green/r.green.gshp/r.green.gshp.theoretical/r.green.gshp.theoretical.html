<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.green.gshp.theoretical</em> assess the shallow geothermal potential defined as the thermal power exchanged by a Borehole Heat Exchanger of a certain depth.
This potential depends on the thermal properties of the ground and the plant features.
This module returns two output raster maps with the the energy potential (MWh/year) and the power potential (W).
In this module the output is the theoretical maximum energy that can be converted in the ideal case without considering the financial and spatial constraints.


<h2>NOTES</h2>

The required inputs are the the thermal conductivity. If not specific values are indicated, reference values have been assumed for the ground features and the plant. <br><br>


<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<em>r.green.gshp.theoretical</em> calculates the potential of shallow geothermal energy by means of and empirical relationship proposed by Casasso et al. (2016) as:
<blockquote><i>
P<SUB>gshp</SUB>=8*(T<SUB>0</SUB> - T<SUB>lim</SUB>) &lambda; L t'<SUB>c</SUB>/(-0.619 t'<SUB>c</SUB>
log(u'<SUB>s</SUB>)-0.455 t'<SUB>c</SUB>-1.619+4 &pi; R<SUB>b</SUB>)</i><br>
<br>
where<blockquote>
T<SUB>0</SUB> is the undisturbed ground temperature (&deg;C),<br>
T<SUB>lim</SUB> the threshold temperature of the heat carrier
fluid setting to 2&deg;C,<br>
&lambda; is the  the
thermal conductivity of the ground (W/(mK)),<br>
L the borehole length (m),<br>
t'<SUB>c</SUB> is is
the operating time ratio ,<br>
u'<SUB>s</SUB> is a parameter depending on the simulaion time and the borehole radius ,<br>
R<SUB>b</SUB> is the thermal resistance (K/W)
</blockquote></blockquote>
