<h2>NAME</h2>

<em>r.fidimo</em> performs analysis of fish dispersal based on
leptokurtic dispersal kernels. It calculates fish dispersal along river
corridors based on a users stream network input, fish source populations
and species-specific dispersal parameters.

<h2>OPTIONS</h2>
<h3>Stream parameters</h3>
<dl>
<dt><b>river</b></dt>
<dd>Name of input stream network map (thinned raster map) on which the
calculations of dispersal is performed. In cases of very maeandering rivers
(with bends narrower than the spatial resolution of the analyis (cell size)
it is recommended to run v.generalize and r.thin and/or to use
<em>r.fidimo.river</em> in advance. The stream network should only consist
of tree like structures, as braiding rivers and networks with two-side
connected side arms will not work. Check the raster beforehand carefully!
</dd>
<dt><b>outflow_point</b></dt>
<dd>Coordinates of outflow point of the basin outlet (see r.stream.basins) 
for the calculationof the flow direction within the provided river network. 
The coordinate pair must be comma separated e.g. X,Y and in the same metric
projected coordinate system as the river network raster. An example outflow
point looks like:
</dd>
</dl>

<div class="code"><pre>
510975,5331275
</pre></div>

<dl>
<dt><b>barriers</b></dt>
<dd>Name of input barrier text-file indicating the geographical position
and passability of barriers e.g. weirs. The file should contain the
X and Y coordinate and a value for permeability (0-1 where 0 is
non-passable and 1 is 100% passable). The values must be |-separated: 
</dd>
</dl>

<div class="code"><pre>
3543350.8001|6064831.9001|1
3535061.5179|6064457.5321|0.3
</pre></div>

<h3>Source populations</h3>
The source populations can be provided either as random points,
or as fixed source population raster:

<dl>
<dt><b>n_source</b></dt>
<dd>For source populations set randomly; number or percentage of cells containing
source populations. The model selects randomly cells within the river network 
(number specified by the user) and assigns a starting density of 1 to each occupied cell.
</dd>
<dt><b>source_populations</b></dt>
<dd>Input raster map indicating the starting density per cell. All
cells with densities &gt; 0 will act as source populations for the model.
The raster map must have the resolution as the river raster and all
source population cells must also be part of the river raster. Source points
at the end points of the network (most upstream cell etc.) might cause problems
with the calculation.
</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Dispersal parameters</h3>

<dl>
<dt><b>species</b></dt>
<dd>Selected species with predefined L and AR (see R-package 'fishmove').
</dd>
<dt><b>L</b></dt>
<dd>Length of fish which should be modelled. Increasing L is positively
correlated with larger dispersal distances. Setting L will overwrite any
species-settings (see R-package 'fishmove').
</dd>
<dt><b>AR</b></dt>
<dd>Aspect ratio of the caudal fin of a fish which should be modelled.
Increasing AR is positively correlated with larger dispersal distances.
etting AR will overwrite any species-settings (see R-package 'fishmove').
</dd>
<dt><b>T</b></dt>
<dd>Time interval for one modelling step. The dispersal kernel is time
dependent and increasing T is positively correlated with larger dispersal
istances (see R-package 'fishmove').
</dd>
<dt><b>p</b></dt>
<dd>Share of the stationary component of the population. The value is
set to 0.67 by default (Radinger and Wolter, 2014, Fish and Fisheries).
</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Output</h3>
<dl>
<dt><b>output</b></dt>
<dd>The base name of the output file(s). The output raster files will
be %output%_fit respectively %output%_lwr and %output%_upr if a
statistical interval is set.
</dd>
<dt><b>statistical_interval</b></dt>
<dd>Statistical interval (confidence or prediction) derived from the
regression analyis (see R-package 'fishmove'). If a statistical interval
is set, three output maps will be created (fit, lwr and upr).
</dd>
</dl>


<h2>Examples</h2>
A GRASS GIS sample location with an extracted river sample river network
can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/jradinger/fidimo_example_mapset">
https://github.com/jradinger/fidimo_example_mapset</a>.
Inside the GRASS-FIDIMO sample mapset it is possible to run following examples:
<h3>Example 1</h3>
<div class="code"><pre>
r.fidimo.py river=example_stream@PERMANENT coors="510975,5331275" n_source="3%" species="Custom species" L=250 AR=1.2 output=fidimo_out_test statistical_interval="Confidence Interval"
</pre></div>
This example calculates fish dispersal for a 250 mm sized (L) species with and aspect ratio (AR) of 1.2.
As starting points (source populations) for dispersal 3% of the river network cells are selected randomly.
In addition also the confidence interval (CI based of the multiple regression model, see Radinger
and Wolter 2014) is calculated and three output maps are produced with the suffix: _fit, _upr, and _lwr.
Note: the calculation of the CI tripples the calculation time.
