<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

The module <em>r.stream.basins</em> is prepared to delineate basins and 
subbasins with different input data. The module is prepared to delineate 
an unrestricted number of basins in one step. It can delineate basins 
with three methods:

<ul>
<li>Using coordinates: this option performs the same operation as <em>r.water.outlet</em>.
<li>Using vector points: it allows to manually point outlets with any method.
<li>Using streams (most advanced): it allows broader functionalities: See the
examples for more details.
</ul>

Only one method can be used at once: the methods cannot be mixed.
<p>
The recommended method requires two maps: flow direction and 
streams. 

<!--FIXME: I do not understand, can this be rephrased? 

Original paragraph:

In spite of streams map we can store information required to 
proper delineation, we can also enumerate stream categories for 
which basins are to be created (cats option). 

My interpretation is the following sentence:
-->

Using cats option it is possible to create basins having the 
same category of the stream they refer to.

The module is prepared to work with output data of <em>r.watershed</em>, 
<em>r.stream.extract</em>, <em>r.stream.order</em> also with modification done by
<em>r.reclass</em> and <em>r.mapcalc</em>. <em>r.stream.basins</em> can delineate 
basins according outlets marked by raster streams, polygons, 
vector points or coordinates. If the outlets are given by 
points or coordinates, the module delineates the basins individuating the cells that 
drain into that point. If the outlets are marked by the streams, it includes the cells 
that contribute to the last (downstream) cell of each stream. 
If the outlets are marked by polygons, it includes the cells contributing to the
most downstream cell of the polygon. If the polygon covers more outlets 
than of one basins, it will create a collective basin for all the outlets  
with common category.

<h2>OPTIONS</h2>
<dl>
<dt><b>-z</b></dt>
<dd>Creates zero-value background instead of NULL. For some reason (like map
algebra calculation) zero-valued background may be required. 
</dd>

<dt><b>-c</b></dt>
<dd>By default <em>r.stream.basins</em> uses streams category as basin category. In some
cases - for example if streams map is a product of map algebra and separate streams
may not have unique values - this option will create a new category sequence for
each basin (it does not work in vector point mode). 
</dd>

<dt><b>-l</b></dt>
<dd>By default <em>r.stream.basins</em> creates basins for all unique streams. This option
delineates basins only for the last streams, ignoring upstream (it does not work in vector
point mode). 
</dd>

<dt><b>direction</b></dt>
<dd> Flow direction: name of input flow direction map produced by
<em>r.watershed</em> or <em>r.stream.extract</em>. 

<!--FIXME: Verify this sentence:

If <em>
r.stream.extract</em> output map is used, it only has non-NULL 
values in places where streams occur. 

My interpretation is that it mixes the flow direction output and the 
stream_rast output.
-->

<!--FIXME: Is the following sentence important? It seems to me that it describes the 
default conditions.

NULL cells are ignored, zero and negative values are valid direction data if they 
vary from -8 to 8 (CCW from East in steps of 45 degrees). Direction 
map shall be of type CELL values.
-->

The resolution of the computational region must match with the resolution of 
the raster map. Also the <em>stream</em> network map (if used) and the direction map 
must have the same resolution. It is checked by default. If resolutions 
differ, the module informs about it and stops. Region boundary and 
maps boundaries may differ but it may lead to unexpected results. 
</dd>

<dt><b>coors</b></dt>
<dd>East and north coordinates for the basin outlet. Using this option, it is possible 
to delineate only one basin at a time, similarly to <em>r.water.outlet</em>. 
</dd>

<dt><b>stream_rast</b></dt>
<dd>Stream network: name of input map of stream network, ordered according to the 
convention used by <em>r.watershed</em> or <em>r.stream.extract</em>.
Since streams network produced by <em>r.watershed</em> and 
<em>r.stream.extract</em> might slightly differ in detail, it is 
required to use both stream and direction map produced by the same 
module. The stream background can have either NULL or zero values. 
</dd>

<dt><b>cats</b></dt>
<dd>Stream categories to delineate basins for: All categories which are not in
the stream map are ignored. It is possible to use the stream network created by
<em>r.watershed</em>, <em>r.stream.extract</em> or <em>r.stream.order</em>.
For <em>r.stream.order</em>, it is possible to select the order for which basins will
be created. For example, to delineate only basins for the streams of second order, 
use <b>cats=2</b>.
If you need unique categories for each basin, use <b>-c</b> flag.
</dd>

<dt><b>points</b></dt>
<dd>Vector file containing basins outlets as vector points. Only points'
categories are used to delineate the basins. Attached tables are ignored. Every
point shall have its own unique category. In this mode, flags <b>-l</b> and
<b>-c</b> are ignored.
</dd>
</dl>

<h2>OUTPUTS</h2>
<p>The module produces one raster map with basins defined according to the user's 
rules.</p>

<h2>NOTES</h2>
<p>
To achieve good results, outlets markers created by the user shall overlap with
the streams, otherwise basins could result with very small area. Input maps
must be in CELL format (default output of <em>r.watershed</em>, 
<em>r.stream.order</em> or <em>r.stream.extract</em>).

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>
<p>
To delineate all basins with categories of streams:

<div class="code"><pre>
r.stream.basins direction=direction stream_rast=streams basins=bas_basins_elem
</pre></div>

<p>
To determine major and minor basins defined by outlets, ignoring
subbasins, use -l flag. This flag ignores all nodes and uses only real outlets
(in most cases that on map border):

<div class="code"><pre>
r.stream.basins -l direction=direction stream_rast=streams basins=bas_basins_last

r.stream.basins direction=direction coors=639936.623832,216939.836449
</pre></div>

<p>
To delineate one or more particular basins defined by given streams, add simply
stream categories:

<div class="code"><pre>
r.stream.basins -lc direction=direction stream_rast=streams cats=2,7,184 basins=bas_basin
</pre></div>

<p>
To delineate basins of particular order, the following procedure can be used: 

<div class="code"><pre>
r.stream.basins -lc direction=direction stream_rast=strahler cats=2 \
  basins=bas_basin_strahler_2
</pre></div>

<p>
The usage of polygons as outlets markers is useful when the exact stream course
cannot be clearly determined before running the analysis, but the area of its
occurrence can be determined (mainly by iterative simulations). In the example,
<em>r.circle</em> is used, but it can be substituted by any polygon created for example  
with <em>v.digit</em>:

<div class="code"><pre>
r.circle -b output=circle coordinate=639936.623832,216939.836449 max=200
r.stream.basins -c direction=direction streams=circle basins=bas_simul
</pre></div>

<p>
To determine areas of contribution to streams of particular order  use as
streams the result of ordering:

<div class="code"><pre>
r.stream.basins direction=direction stream_rast=ord_strahler basins=bas_basin_strahler
</pre></div>

<p>
Determination of areas of potential source of pollution. The example will be
done for lake marked with FULL_HYDR 8056 in North Carolina sample dataset. The
lake shall be extracted and converted to binary raster map.

<div class="code"><pre>
v.extract -d input=lakes@PERMANENT output=lake8056 type=area layer=1 \
  where='FULL_HYDRO = 8056' new=-1 

v.to.rast input=lake8056 output=lake8056 use=val type=area layer=1 value=1

r.stream.basins direction=direction streams=lake8056 basins=bas_basin_lake
</pre></div>
