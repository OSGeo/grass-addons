<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.terracost</em> is a scalable approach for computing least-cost-path
surfaces on massive grid terrains. The module outperforms standard solutions
as dataset size increases relative to available memory.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

<em>r.terracost</em> computes a least-cost surface for a given cost grid and 
set of start points using an approach that scales to large grids. For details,
see paper <i>"TerraCost: A Versatile and Scalable Approach for Path 
Computations on Massive Grid-Based Terrains"</i> by Hazel, Toma, Vahrenhold 
and Wickremesinghe (2006). The basic idea is to split the grid in tiles. 

<em>numtiles</em> is the number of tiles. Run with <em>-i</em> to see the recommended
value for <em>numtiles</em>. When <em>numtiles=1</em> it runs Dijkstra's algorithm in
memory. When <em>numtiles &gt; 1</em> it runs an external SP algorithm that consists
of 5 steps. For debugging purposes, it is possible to run the five steps separately.
When running in separate steps, an intermediate config file stores temporary information,
and other streams (see below) contain intermediate data. 

<ul>
<li> Step 0 (setup) inputs from GRASS; outputs are "S0OUT" and "S0BND" 

<li> Step 1 (compute substitute graph: intra-tile Dijkstra) inputs are "S0OUT" 
  and "S0BND"; outputs are "S1OUT" and "S2BOUT"

<li> Step 2 (sorting) input is "S1OUT"; output is "S1OUT"

<li> Step 3 (inter-tile)  inputs are "S0OUT", "S0BND",  "S1OUT", and "S2BOUT";
   output is "PHASE2BND"

<!-- next unclear - explain better! -->
<li> Step 4 (final-tile) inputs are "S0OUT" and "PHASE2BND";  output goes to
  GRASS maps: Map names are specified relative to "VTMPDIR", or with absolute path 
 (name beginning with /).
</ul>

IOLibrary temporary streams will be in STREAM_DIR.
