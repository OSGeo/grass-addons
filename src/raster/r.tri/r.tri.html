<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p><i>r.tri </i>calculates the Terrain Ruggedness Index (TRI) of Riley et al.
    (1999). The index represents the mean change in elevation between a grid
    cell and its neighbours, over a user-specified moving window size. The
    original calculation in Riley et al. (1999) used only a 3x3 neighbourhood
    and represented the sum of the absolute deviations between the center pixel
    and its immediate 8 neighbours. In r.tri, this calculation is modified so
    that the calculation can be extended over any scale by taking the mean of
    the absolute deviations.</p>

<h2>NOTES</h2>

<p>
    <i>r.tri</i> produces fairly similar results to the average deviation of
    elevation values, apart from the center pixel is used in place of the mean.
    In practice, this produces a slightly less smoothed result that can
    potentially highlight finer-scale terrain features. However, because the
    terrain ruggedness index does not consider the distance of each cell from
    the centre cell in it's calculation, the TRI results can become noisy with
    large window sizes. To avoid this, weighting each cell by the inverse of
    its distance can be used by setting the <i>exponent</i> parameter to &gt 0.
</p>

<p>
    Similar to many other GRASS GIS algorithms, cell padding is not performed
    automatically which will leave null values at the boundaries of the output
    raster relative to the size of the input raster. To minimize this effect
    the DEM needs to be buffered/grown prior to using r.tri.
</p>

<p>
    Currently, <i>r.tri</i> is implemented using a <i>r.mapcalc</i> focal
    function. This becomes slow for large window sizes. To reduce computational
    times for large raster datasets, setting <em>processes</em> parameter to 
    &gt 1 will use a parallelized and tiled calculations that is spread across
    multiple processing cores. This option requires the GRASS addon
    <a href="r.mapcalc.tiled.html">r.mapcalc.tiled</a> to be installed.
