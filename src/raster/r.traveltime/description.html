<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<em>r.traveltime</em> computes the travel time of surface runoff to an
outlet. The program starts at the basin outlet and calculates the travel
time at each raster cell recursively. A drainage area related threhold
considers even&nbsp; surface and also channel runoff. Travel times are
derived by assuming kinematic wave approximation.<br>
To derive channel flow velocities an equilibrium discharge for each
cell is calculated (Q=Area*Excess_Prcipitation, Assumption: storm
duration &gt;= time of concentration).&nbsp; This assumption may result
in overestimated velocities. Therefor a factor is implemented to reduce
velocities biased towards too large values.<br>
The results can be used to derive a time-area function. This might be
usefull for precipitation-runoff calculations (estimation of flood
predictions) with a lumped hydrologic model (user-specified unit
hydrograph).

<h2>REMARKS</h2>
The program ist restricted to SI units (meters). The algorithm is
recursive. Maybe it will not work with extensive datasets. It is
assumed that the minimum slope is 0.001. For smaller gradients the
program uses this value.

<h2>KNOWN ISSUES</h2>
The program does not work correctly if Manning's roughness grid is
defined as double (float expected). To define a simple uniform
roughness distribution try: r.mapcalc 'roughness=0.1f'
<br>
The region has to be set one row and column larger than the elevation
map. See the example below to see how to do that with g.region.

<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>
<i>This example uses the North Carolina sample dataset.</i>
