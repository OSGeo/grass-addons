<em>r.forcircular</em> identifies forest areas potentially exploitable from both
technical (according to geomorphological, logistic and mechanization variables)
and economic (through the estimation of stumpage value) points of view.
Subsequently, the use of indicators belonging to the 4R framework of the
circular economy (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Recover) allows to evaluate the level
of circularity of the forest-wood supply chain. Finally, the application of
spatial multicriteria analysis (SMCA) (specifically with compromise programming
- CP - technique) permits to merge in a unique measure the level of circular
bioeconomy for production of traditional wood assortments and bioenergy in
forest areas. In the SMCA procedure, each indicator is weighted according to
on-line questionnaire proposed to decision makers operating in the forest-based
sector. The list of indicators used is the following:
<br><br>
<table border=1 cellpadding=3px>
    <tr>
        <td>4R</td>
        <td>INDICATORS</td>
        <td>DEFINITION</td>

    <tr>
        <td>Reduce</td>
        <td>i1 - Ratio (on annual basis) between annual value and annual mean

        <td>i5 - Ratio between the potential economic value of the wood
            assortment and the real value earned</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Recover</td>
        <td>i6 - Percentage of wood waste for bioenergy production
            <hr> i7 - Amount of CO2 emissions saved per unit of energy produced
            by wood wastes
        </td>
        <td>Energy recovery from wood waste products; Emissions saved from
            energy recovery from wood waste products</td>
    </tr>

<p>
The quantification of circular bioeconomy indicators is developed in the
framework of provisioning forest ecosystem services. For this reason, the
indicators and results of SMCA process are computed on forest surface with
financial efficiency of production process or, in other terms, the area
where a positive stumpage value can be reached. The calculation of stumpage
value is carried out following the approach of another GRASS GIS add-on: <a
href="r.green.biomassfor.html">r.green.biomassfor</a>.

<p>
The model in <em>r.forcircular</em> starts with importation of geodata and
conversion of vector intp raster. Then, through a multistep approach, the
technical and the economic availability
of biomass (both traditional wood assortments and woodchips for bioenergy
production) are quantified. Technical availability depicts forest surface
where the extraction of wood material is possible.
The approach combines type of mechanisation, limits for slope,
distance from roads and roughness. <br>
In forest area where extraction is possible, the stumpage value is
quantified as a combination of differenct factors such as
hourly unitary cost of each production process, worker costs,
hourly productivity and administrative costs.
<br>
The user can setthe upper and - if needed - lower limits for slope and
distance
from roads to obtain the technical surface:

</div>
In forest area where extraction is possible, the stumpage value is
quantified as
follow:

<div align="center" style="margin: 10px">
<a href="stumpage_function.png"><img src="stumpage_function.png" width="600"></a>
</div>
Subsequently, the 4R indicators are calculated on the forest area with
positive revenue. <br> <br>
The importance of each circular bioeconomy index derives from the work of
Paletto et al. (see Paletto A, Becagli C, Geri F, et al (2022) Use of
Participatory Processes in Wood Residue Management from a Circular
Bioeconomy Perspective: An Approach Adopted in Italy. Energies 15:1011)
where - starting from a total sample of 56 decision makers operating
in forest-based sectorin Italy - 30 decision makers
filled out a questionnaire.
The decision makers involved in the study have been identified
based on their knowledge and experience in the fields of bioeconomy,
circular economic, and forest policy.
According to the outputs provided by Paletto et al., the values of indices currently
applied in <em>r.forcircular</em> (but modifiable by users) are: i1=0.15,
i2=0.12, i3=0.12, i4=0.13, i5=0.14, i6=0.17, i7=0.16.

<p>
<em>r.forcircular</em> highlights the output in both numerical and
geographical format. By means of zonal statistics operations following
results can be reported for the forest surface where stumpage value is
greater then 0: annual availability of assortments (m<sup>3</sup>/y)
recalibrated in category of harvested material (i.e., roundwood, timber
pole, firewood, woodchips converted in bioenergy and expressed in MWh/y),
annual stumpage value (&euro;/y), average annual stumpage value
(&euro;/ha·y-1), average stumpage value at harvesting
(&euro;/ha) and avoided CO<sub>2</sub> emissions (tCO<sub>2</sub>/y). <br>
<br>
Quantification of circular bioeconomy is expressed by a SMCA procedure based
on compromise programming (CP) technique. CP depicts the distance from the
so-called “ideal” point, a hypothetical alternative defined as the most
suitable level for each indicator (i) in the considered scenario.
The distance from ideal point (DIP) is measured with the decision rule: <br>

<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>
This example is based on the case-study of Municipality Union of the Sieve and
Arno valleys (province of Florence, Tuscany, Italy). The territory is
mountainous and is located in the central Apennine. The surface of Municipality
Union is 49,500 hectares with a forest index of 62%. Woodlands are
mainly composed by broadleaved forests (84%), followed by conifers (10%) and
mixed forests of broadleaved and conifers (6%).
Below you can see the vector parcel file, with a field structure like the
manatory field scheme described above.

On the basis of this example the correct syntax to run the module is:
<div class="code"><pre>
r.forcircular forest=parcel boundaries=study_Area dtm=dem tracks=forest_tracks \
  rivers=rivers lakes=lakes protected_areas=reserved slp_min_cc=30. slp_max_cc=100. \

  hf_noslope="tractor" c_noslope="tractor" ind1=indicator1 ind2=indicator2 ind3=indicator3 \
  ind4=indicator4 ind5=indicator5 ind6=indicator6 ind7=indicator7
</pre></div>

<p>
The output maps are: technical_surface (forest surface where exploitation is
technically possibile), economic_surface (forest surface where the exploitation
is economically advantageous), emission (CO<sub>2</sub> produced by the
exploitation), annual_avoided_emission (emissions avoided compared to the use of
fossil fuels), revenues (map of economic revenues), dip (distance from ideal,
the assessment of the circular economy level of the forest supply chain).
Below there are two examples of the output maps corresponding respectively to
the
stumpage value and the annual avoided emission: <br><br>
