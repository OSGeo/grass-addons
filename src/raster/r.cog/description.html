<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>


<em>r.cog</em> finds the center of gravity of a raster map, with respect
to occupied cells in the x,y plane, and the mean z-value of the raster
data. By default it prints out the <tt>easting,northing</tt> of the center
cell and the mean of the raster map to give the "pivot point". If the <b>-a</b>
flag is given it will also print out the generalized azimuth and dip angle
of the surface. Angles are measured in degrees; azimuth is measured CCW from
the +x axis, and dip angle is measured downwards along the direction of the
azimuth.

<p>
These outputs can be printed in shell script format suitable for parsing by
using the <b>-g</b> flag. In that case the order of terms is
<tt>easting|northing|elevation|azimuth|dip</tt>.

<p>
If the <b>plane</b> option is used, a new raster map is created in the plane
of the overall azimuth and dip trends.

<p>
For a categorical maps you can optionally select the categories to consider.
This mode is not currently compatible with the angle output or plane output
options.

<p>
Optionally it will draw a marker on the Xmonitor using the <em>d.mark</em>
module from GRASS addons (d.shortcuts).
