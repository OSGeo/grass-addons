<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

Module <em>r.pops.spread</em>
is a dynamic species distribution model for pest or pathogen spread in forest
or agricultural ecosystems. The model is process based
meaning that it uses understanding of the effect of weather on reproduction
and survival of the pest or pathogen in order to simulate
spread of the pest or pathogen into the future using simulation.

<h3>About the model</h3>

<p>
The module is using the PoPS Core library which is implementing
the PoPS model and it is a central part of the
<a href="https://popsmodel.org/">Pest or Pathogen Spread (PoPS)</a> project.

<p>
The PoPS model is a stochastic spread model of pests
and pathogens in forest and agricultural landscapes.
It is used for various pest, pathogens, and hosts including animals,
not just plants, as hosts.
It was originally developed for <em>Phytophthora ramorum</em> and the original
version of the model was written in R, later with Rcpp (Tonini, 2017),
and was based on Meentemeyer (2011) paper.

<p>
The current implementation of the GRASS GIS module is using PoPS Core
header-only C++ library which implements the PoPS model.
The primary development of
<a href="https://github.com/ncsu-landscape-dynamics/pops-core">PoPS Core</a>
and of
<a href="https://github.com/ncsu-landscape-dynamics/r.pops.spread">this module</a>
happens in a
separate repositories and GRASS GIS Addons repository contains the latest
release of the model.
An alternative
<a href="https://github.com/ncsu-landscape-dynamics/r.pops.spread/tree/steering">steering version</a>
of this module exists which includes a set of
features supporting geospatial simulation steering (Petrasova, 2020)
which is useful for exploring adaptive management scenarios.

<h3>Model parameters</h3>

Two basic epidemiological model types (<b>model_type</b>) are available for a transition
of hosts between susceptible and infected classes:
1) susceptible-infected (SI) for an immediate transition when
a disperser establishes on the host and
2) susceptible-exposed-infected (SEI) for an intermediate state when
the host first becomes exposed and only after a latency period
(<b>latency_period</b>) is over.

This page lists above the numerous inputs and parameters, although many
of them have default values, some need careful consideration and
calibration. The best way how to identify options relevant to
a given use case is to go through one of the available tutorials.

<h3>Calibration</h3>

Typically, the model needs to be calibrated.
You can obtain the calibration from a published work,
colleague, calibrate the model manually (in GRASS GIS),
or use the R interface to PoPS called
<a href="https://github.com/ncsu-landscape-dynamics/rpops">rpops</a>
which has dedicated functions for calibration.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

<ul>

<li>
The directions of wind consider north (N) to be grid north, if your
true north is different direction, you need to make an adjustment.

<li>
The module currently does not handle NULL (no data) as input, so you
need to change the NULLs to (most likely) zeros, for example:
<code>r.null map=infection null=0</code>.

</ul>


<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

<h3>Obtaining list of rasters</h3>
Use <a href="https://github.com/ncsu-landscape-dynamics/weather-coefficient">
    R script</a> to create weather coefficients based on a defined polynomial.
<p>
Example of creating file with list of input maps (unix-like command
line):

<div class="code"><pre>
g.list type=raster pattern="moisture_*" mapset=climate -m > moistures.txt
g.list type=raster pattern="temperature_*" mapset=climate -m > temperatures.txt
</pre></div>

Note that the above assumes that the names will be ordered by time.
This will happen automatically if they are, e.g. numbered as 001, 002,
etc. (e.g. <tt>temperature_001</tt> and not <tt>temperature_1</tt>).
If they are numbered without the zero-padding, i.e. 1, 2, ..., 10,
11, ..., then in a unix-like command line, you can do pipe the result
through <em>sort</em> with <tt>-n</tt> (<tt>| sort -n</tt>).
For example, for map names like <tt>temperature_1</tt>, the following
unix-like command will do the sorting:

<div class="code"><pre>
g.list type=raster pattern="temperature_*" mapset=climate | sort -k2 -t_ -n > temperatures.txt
</pre></div>

Note the underscore which tells sort where to split the name for sorting
and the number 2 which indicates which part of the name to use for
sorting after splitting.

If you have the weather-related timeseries in a separate mapset, you
can add this mapset to the search path of your current mapset so that
you can have the rasters in the list without specifying the mapset.
To add to the search path, use for example:

<div class="code"><pre>
g.mapsets mapset=climate
</pre></div>


<h3>Generating a constant coefficient</h3>

In case the moisture coefficient is not used, we can generate a constant
raster map to be used as the coefficient:

<div class="code"><pre>
r.mapcalc "const_1 = 1"
</pre></div>

Then using unix-like command line, we can create a list of these rasters
in a file based on the number of lines in a temperature list files we
created earlier:

<div class="code"><pre>
NUM_LINES=`cat temperatures.txt | wc -l`
echo const_1 > moistures.txt
for LINE in `seq 2 $NUM_LINES`; do echo const_1 >> moistures.txt; done;
</pre></div>

<h3>Creating treatments</h3>
To account for (vector) treatments partially covering host cells:

<div class="code"><pre>
# set resolution for treatments and convert to raster
g.region res=10 -ap
v.to.rast input=treatment output=treatment use=val

# resample to lower resolution (match host map resolution)
g.region align=host_map -p
r.resamp.stats -w input=treatment output=treatment_resampled method=count
# get maximum value, which is dependent on resolution
# e.g. when resampling from 10m to 100m, max will be 100 (100 small cells in 1 big cell)
r.info -r treatment_resampled
# result will be 0 to 1
r.mapcalc "treatment_float = test_treatment_resampled / 100"
# adjust host layer
r.mapcalc "treated_host = host - host * treatment_float"
</pre></div>

<h3>Running the model</h3>

Example of the run of the model (unix-like command line):

<div class="code"><pre>
r.pops.spread host=host total_plants=all infected=infected_2005 \
    moisture_coefficient_file=moistures.txt temperature_coefficient_file=temperatures.txt \
    output=spread step=week start_time=2005 end_time=2010 \
    reproductive_rate=4 dispersal_kernel=cauchy wind=NE random_seed=4
</pre></div>
