/*! The main class to control the spread simulation.
 *
 * The Simulation class handles the mechanics of the model, but the
 * timing of the events or steps should be handled outside of this
 * class unless noted otherwise. The notable exceptions are exposed
 * hosts in the SEI model type and mortality.
 *
 * The template parameters IntegerRaster and FloatRaster are raster
 * image or matrix types. Any 2D numerical array should work as long as
 * it uses function call operator to access the values, i.e. it provides
 * indexing for reading and writing values using `()`. In other words,
 * the operations such as the two following ones should be possible:
 *
 * ```
 * a(i, j) = 1;
 * a(i, j) == 1;
 * ```
 *
 * The PoPS library offers a Raster template class to fill this role,
 * but other classes can be used as well.
 *
 * Template parameter RasterIndex is type used for maximum indices of
 * the used rasters and should be the same as what the actual raster
 * types are using. However, at the same time, comparison with signed
 * type are perfomed and a signed type might be required in the future.
 * A default is provided, but it can be changed in the future.

    /** Infect exposed hosts (E to I transition in the SEI model)
     *
     * Applicable to SEI model, no-operation otherwise, i.e., parameters
     * are left intact for other models.
     *
     * The exposed vector are the hosts exposed in the previous steps.
     * The length of the vector is the number of steps of the latency
     * period plus one. Before the first latency period is over,
     * the E to I transition won't happen because no item in the exposed
     * vector is old enough to become infected.
     *
     * The position of the items in the exposed vector determines their
     * age, i.e., for how long the hosts are exposed. The oldest item
     * is at the front and youngest at the end.
     * Before the the first latency period is over, items in the front
     * are still empty (unused) because no hosts were exposed for the
     * given time period.
     * After the first latency
     * period, this needs to be true before the function is called and
     * it is true after the function
     * finished with the difference that after the function is called,
     * the last item is empty in the sense that it does not contain any
     * hosts.
     *
     * When the E to I transition happens, hosts from the oldest item
     * in the exposed vector are moved to the infected (and mortality
     * tracker). They are removed from the exposed item and this item
     * is moved to the back of the vector.
     *
     * Like in disperse(), there is no distinction between *infected*
     * and *mortality_tracker*, but different usage is expected outside
     * of this function.
     *
     * The raster class used with the simulation class needs to support
     * `.fill()` method for this function to work.
     *
     * @param step Step in the simulation (>=0)
     * @param exposed Vector of exposed hosts
     * @param infected Infected hosts
     * @param mortality_tracker Newly infected hosts

     * This function wraps disperse() and infect_exposed() for use in SI
     * and SEI models.
     *
     * In case of SEI model, before calling this function, last item in
     * the exposed vector needs to be ready to be used for exposure,
     * i.e., typically, it should be empty in the sense that there are
     * no hosts in the raster. This is normally taken care of by a
     * previous call to this function. The initial state of the exposed
     * vector should be such that size is latency period in steps plus 1
     * and each raster is empty, i.e., does not contain any hosts
     * (all values set to zero).
     *
     * See the infect_exposed() function for the details about exposed
     * vector, its size, and its items.
     *
     * See disperse() and infect_exposed() for a detailed list of
     * parameters and behavior. The disperse() parameter documentation
     * can be applied as is except that disperse() function's parameter
     * *exposed_or_infested* is expected to change based on the context
     * while this function's parameter *infected* is always the infected
     * individuals. Besides parameters from disperse(), this function
     * has parameter *exposed* which is the same as the one from the
