# r.pops.spread

This is a GRASS GIS module *r.pops.spread* for simulating spread of
pests and pathogens. The module is a GRASS GIS interface to the PoPS
(Pest or Pathogen Spread) model implemented in C++ library maintained
in the [PoPS Core repository](https://github.com/ncsu-landscape-dynamics/pops-core).

The purpose of the *r.pops.spread* module is to provide easy way of
running the model in GRASS GIS environment once you have calibrated
the model for your purposes. You can obtain the calibration from a
colleague or published work or you can calibrate the model manually (in
GRASS GIS) or use the R interface to PoPS called
[rpops](https://github.com/ncsu-landscape-dynamics/rpops) to do that.

Note: Earlier versions of this module were called *r.spread.pest* and
*r.spread.sod*.

## Download

### Download and install

The latest release of the *r.pops.spread* module is available in GRASS GIS Addons repository
and can be installed directly in GRASS GIS through graphical user
interface or using the following command:

```
g.extension r.pops.spread
```

Alternatively, you can obtain latest source code here and install it
from this repository (see below).

### Source code download

Just use Git, but note that the
PoPS Core library is in a submodule, so use `--recursive` when cloning,
for example:

```
git clone --recursive git@github.com:ncsu-landscape-dynamics/r.pops.spread.git
```

If you have already cloned, you can obtain the submodules using:

```
git submodule update --init
```

Note that downloading as ZIP won't include the source code for the submodule,
so downloading as ZIP is not useful for this repo.

## Contributing

Please see the [pops-core](https://github.com/ncsu-landscape-dynamics/pops-core#readme) repository
for contributing best practices and release policies.
Other than that, just open pull requests against this repo.

### Updating submodule to latest version

To update the submodule, i.e. update submodule's commit used in this
repository, use:

```
git submodule update --remote
```

Note that this change is recorded in the repository. In other words,
the latest commit of a submodule is part of this repository.
The reason for this is that the code in this repository is linked to a
particular commit in the submodule repository (rather than the latest
version). Git works this way to avoid breaking things unexpectedly due
to changes in the submodule repository.

### Updating the code of the submodule

```
cd pops
git checkout master
git add file.hpp
git commit -m "this and that change"
git push
```

```
cd ..
git commit pops -m "update to latest pops commit"
git push
```

## The files

The `main.cpp` file contains the main program to run.
The model is in `pops-core/include/pops-core` directory.

## To run the model

You can use Linux to run the model in the following way.

Open an terminal and install dependencies:

    sudo apt-get install grass grass-dev

Download this repo using Git (see above):

    git clone ...

Change the current directory to the model directory:

    cd ...

Compile:

    grass --tmp-location XY --exec g.extension module=r.pops.spread url=.

Run (assuming you checked how to create a GRASS GIS mapset with our data):

    grass .../modeling/scenario1 --exec r.pops.spread ...
