<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.seriesboxplot</em> draws boxplots of series of input raster 
layers. It can be used to display both temporal patterns and spatial 
variation.

<p>
The whiskers of the boxplots extend to the most extreme data point, 
which is no more than <i>range</i> &#10005; the interquartile range 
(iqr) from the box. By default, a <i>range</i> of 1.5 is used, but the 
user can change this. Note that range values need to be larger than 0. 
By default, outliers are not included in the plot. Set the -o flag to 
include them in the plot. 

<p>
There are a few layout options, including the option to rotate the 
plot and the x-axis labels, print the boxplot(s) with notches, and 
define the color of the boxplots. 

<p> By default, the raster names are used as labels, but the user can 
explicitly define the labels (example 3 below). The number of labels 
need to be the same as the number of input raster layers.

<p>
By default, the resulting plot is displayed on screen. However, the 
user can also save the plot to file using the em>output</em> option. 
The format is determined by the extension given by the user. So, if 
output = outputfile.png, the plot will be saved as a *png* file. The 
user can set the output size (in inches) and resolution (dpi) of the 
output image.

<h2>NOTE</h2>

If you work with a large number of raster layers, of if the raster 
layers are very large, try to avoid setting the 'range' value very low, 
as that may result in a massive number of outliers, slowing down the 
computations and rendering of the plot. 


<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>

The examples use the North Carolina full dataset, which you can 
download from 
[here](https://grass.osgeo.org/download/data/#NorthCarolinaDataset). 

<h3>Example 1</h3>

Three landsat layers are provided as input. In addition, plot 
dimensions are set to 12 inch wide, 6 inch height.

<div class="code"><pre>
r.series.boxplot plot_dimensions=12,6 \
map=lsat7_2002_10,lsat7_2002_20,lsat7_2002_30,lsat7_2002_40,lsat7_2002_50
</pre></div>

<h3>Example 2</h3>

The example below uses the same layers as input. In addition, it 
defines the colors for the boxplots, rotates the labels and sets the 
fontsize to 14.

<div class="code"><pre>
r.series.boxplot plot_dimensions=12,6 \
map=lsat7_2002_10,lsat7_2002_20,lsat7_2002_30,lsat7_2002_40,lsat7_2002_50 \
bxcolor=green rotate_labels=45 fontsize=14
</pre></div>

<p>
See [here](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/colors/colors.html) 
for the different formats in which colors can be specified.

<h3>Example 3</h3>

Same example as above, but this time, the outliers are plotted as well 
(in blue). And the labels are explicitly defined.

<div class="code"><pre>
r.series.boxplot -o plot_dimensions=12,6 rotate_labels=45 fontsize=14 \
map=lsat7_2002_10,lsat7_2002_20,lsat7_2002_30,lsat7_2002_40,lsat7_2002_50 \
flier_color=blue bxcolor=green \
text_labels="2002 10,2002 20,2002 30,2002 40,2002 50"
</pre></div>
