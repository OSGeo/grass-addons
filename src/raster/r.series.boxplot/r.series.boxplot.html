<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.seriesboxplot</em> draws boxplots of series of input raster
layers. It can be used to display both temporal patterns and spatial
variation.

<p>
The whiskers of the boxplots extend to the most extreme data point,
which is no more than <b>range</b> &#10005; the interquartile range
(iqr) from the box. By default, a <b>range</b> of 1.5 is used, but the
user can change this. Note that range values need to be larger than 0.
By default, outliers are not included in the plot. Set the -o flag to
include them in the plot.

<p>
There are a few layout options, including the option to rotate the
plot and the x-axis labels, print the boxplot(s) with notches, and
define the color of the boxplots.

<p> By default, the raster names are used as labels, but the user can
explicitly define the labels (example 3 below). The number of labels
need to be the same as the number of input raster layers.

<p>
By default, the resulting plot is displayed on screen. However, the
user can also save the plot to file using the <b>output</b> option.
The format is determined by the extension given by the user. So, if
<b>output = outputfile.png</b>, the plot will be saved as a PNG file. The
user can set the output size (in inches) and resolution (dpi) of the
output image.

<h2>NOTE</h2>

If you work with a large number of raster layers, of if the raster
layers are very large, try to avoid setting the range value very low,
as that may result in a massive number of outliers, slowing down the
computations and rendering of the plot.


<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>

The examples use the North Carolina full dataset, which you can
download from
<a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/download/data/#NorthCarolinaDataset" target="_blank">here</a>.

<h3>Example 1</h3>

Three landsat layers are provided as input. In addition, plot
dimensions are set to 12 inch wide, 6 inch height.

<div class="code"><pre>
r.series.boxplot plot_dimensions=12,6 \
map=lsat7_2002_10,lsat7_2002_20,lsat7_2002_30,lsat7_2002_40,lsat7_2002_50
</pre></div>

<p>
<div align="center" style="margin: 10px">
<img src="r_series_boxplot_1.png">
</div>

<h3>Example 2</h3>

The example below uses the same layers as input. In addition, it
defines the colors for the boxplots, rotates the labels and sets the
fontsize to 14.

<div class="code"><pre>
r.series.boxplot plot_dimensions=12,6 \
map=lsat7_2002_10,lsat7_2002_20,lsat7_2002_30,lsat7_2002_40,lsat7_2002_50 \
bxcolor=green rotate_labels=45 fontsize=14
</pre></div>

<p>
See <a href="https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/colors/colors.html" target="_blank">here</a>
for the different formats in which colors can be specified.

</div>

<h3>Example 3</h3>

Same example as above, but this time, the outliers are plotted as well
(in blue). And the labels are explicitly defined.

<div class="code"><pre>
r.series.boxplot -o plot_dimensions=12,6 rotate_labels=45 fontsize=14 \
map=lsat7_2002_10,lsat7_2002_20,lsat7_2002_30,lsat7_2002_40,lsat7_2002_50 \
flier_color=blue bxcolor=green \
text_labels="2002 10,2002 20,2002 30,2002 40,2002 50"
</pre></div>
