<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>  

<em>r.survey</em> is aimed at earth surface 
analysis. It is useful for evaluating the visibility (in terms of 3D 
Distance, Solid Angle and orientation of the terrain respect to the 
line of sight) of  features lying on the terrain slope, like 
landslides, road cuts, minor vegetation, mining activity, geological 
outcrops, surface pipelines, parking areas, solar panels plants, burned 
areas, etc. 
<p>
 Depending on the purpose of the study, one can be 
interested in searching the closest position to observe a given 
territory while for others, having a frontal view can be more relevant. 
In some cases, the objective could be the combined balance between the 
closest and the most frontal view, in order to evaluate how much of the 
human field of view is occupied by a given object (solid angle). 
<p> 
<em>r.survey</em> is deeply based on the powerful <em>r.viewshed</em> 
GRASS GIS module.
<p> 
<em>r.survey</em> wants to provide the user the 
necessary information to answer questions such as: 
<ul> 
<li> In a survey trip, from how many places is something visible?</li>
<li> During a field work, which place would be the best position to observe 
a given point/area (according to the distance, the angle or both)?</li>
<li> Which portion of the territory is visible along a survey 
path/flight?</li> 
<li> Are objects of a given size visible from a 
survey path/flight?</li> 
</ul> 
Three principal outputs (visibility 
indexes) are given, based on trigonometric calculations in order to 
provide qualitative and quantitative information about how the terrain 
is perceived from the selected observation point (or viewpoint). This 
information concerns the three-dimensional distance, the relative 
orientation (View Angle) and the Solid Angle, of each target pixel with 
respect to the viewpoint. 
<p> 
A map containing a set of points 
describing the locations of the observer and a digital elevation model 
(DEM) are the mandatory inputs for <em>r.survey</em>. <i>It is very 
importante that all observation points have different categories, i.e. 
cat values (see the examples below)</i>. 
In addition, maps of buildings 
and trees, portraying height information, can be used to alter the DEM. 
In the case of trees map, apart from the height value, a third column 
in the attribute table has to contain the standard deviation value 
related to the heigh. This is used to simulate the rougness of forested 
areas. 
<p>
Many other options can be set according to the aim of the 
analysis, such as: observer height respect to the ground or respect to 
an elevation datum (absolute elevation), maximum distance to perform 
the calculations, a view-angle threshold to exclude, a priori, cell 
oriented almost perpendicularly to the lines of sight, the average size 
of the observed object. The input points map must be provided to the 
tool as a vector layer. In case it represents the positions of a UAV, 
an helicopter or of a satellite, it must include an attribute field 
containing absolute elevation values with respect to a vertical datum 
(the same datum used by the input DEM). Observer height (respect to the 
ground, the default is 1.75 m) and maximum distance of observation 
(default is 1000 m)  are parameters needed by the r.viewshed module. 
The object radius is used to approximate, with an equivalent circle, 
the minimum size of an object centered in the cells center and oriented 
according to the slope and aspect of the cells. Since r.survey produces 
different types of outputs, a name to be used for the prefix of the 
output maps is requested.  

<p> 
<p>

3D Distance is the three 
dimensional linear distance between a viewpoint and a target pixel (see 
the illutratio bellow). The min3dDistance map portrays  the value of 
the minimum three-dimensional distance between each pixel and the 
closest viewpoint, in meters.

<p> 
Given a 
viewpoint, r.survey calculate the unit vector describing direction and 
sense of the line of sight between that viewpoint and each visible 
pixel (see illustration bellow). We define View Angle as the angle 
between the unit vector representing the line of sight and the unit 
vector normal to the terrain surface in each pixel. The maxViewAngle 
map shows the value of the maximum View Angle between each pixel and 
the viewpoints, in degrees. It is a measure of the most frontal view 
each single cell is visible from.  View angle output is always larger 
than 90&deg; and smaller than 180&deg;.

Solid Angle is one of the best and most objective indicators for quantifying 
the visibility. The idea is that any observed object will be 
progressively less appreciable the more far away and the more tilted it 
is with regard to the viewpoint. As a consequence Solid Angle depends 
on the size of the observed object as well as on the distance and the 
orientation from where this object is observed. Solid Angle of a 
surface is, by definition, equal to the projected spherical surface in 
the evolving sphere divided by the square of the radius of the sphere. 
As an aproximation, we use the ellipse surface area in place of the 
projected spherical surface in the evolving sphere. The maxSolidAngle 
map shows the value of the maximum Solid Angle (expressed in 
steradians) among those measured from the different viewpoints. In this 
map, the closest pixels to the observation points have to be 
interpreted with special attention, considering that the error, respect 
to the real Solid Angle, can reach until the 10% in the immediate 
neighbor pixels. For reference: 1 sr is equal to approximately 3283 
(deg<sup>2</sup>) square degrees and to 1.18 x 10<sup>7</sup> square 
minutes (min<sup>2</sup>). It means that 2 x 10<sup>-6</sup> sr = 23.6 
min<sup>2</sup>. For comparison, letter acuity (the capacity to resolve 
a letter) is approximately 25 min<sup>2</sup> for a human with perfect 
vision and in controlled conditions, that is, high contrast between the 
letters and the background. 
<p> 
Other three maps 
(pointOfViewWithMin3dDistance, pointOfViewWithMmaxAngle and 
pointOfViewWithMmaxSolidAngle) are used to register, in each cell, the 
identifier of the viewpoints from where an observer can get, 
respectively, (i) the minimum values of 3D Distance, (ii) the maximum 
values of View Angle and (iii) the maximum value of the Solid Angle. 
Another relevant output is the numberOfViews map which portraits the 
number of viewpoints from where each pixel is visible.   


<h2>NOTES</h2> 
The software was designed as a GRASS GIS python module whose source 
code was  written using the GRASS Scripting library and the pyGRASS 
library. 
<p> 
Multi-core processing is used by <em>r.survey</em> for 
reducing the computational time. When the aim is to derive the values 
of the visibility indexes along a given path (e.g. a road or a UAV 
track) viewpoints can be very dense in terms of number per unit of 
distance and the more the viewpoints are,  the longer the computational 
time becomes. 
<p> 
Parallel computation was implemented exploiting the 
Python Multiprocessing library and the ability of GRASS GIS to set a 
temporary spatial region centered on the considered point without 
affecting the parallel computation of the other points. 


<h2>EXAMPLES</h2> 
The location used for the following examples can be 
downloaded <a href="https://github.com/IvanMarchesini/r.survey.py">here</a>. The name 
is R.SURVEY_Location   

<h3>Visibility from roads</h3>  

The most common 
usage of this tool is to model the visibility from the roads, for which 
a set of points located along the roads is needed. We are going to 
create a sample of points each 50 meters along the road.  

<br> 
<div class="code"><pre> 
g.region raster=dem v.build.polylines input=roads output=roads_poly cats=multi  # Convert the road layer into polyline 
v.to.points input=roads_poly output=points_50 dmax=50  # A point is created each 50 meters  

## Ensure that each point has an independent category value ## 
v.category input=points_50 output=points_50_del option=del cat=-1 
v.category input=points_50_del output=points_50_add option=add cat=1 
</pre></div>  

<h3>Running r.survey in parallel</h3> 
This example shows how to run <em>r.survey</em> calculating the solid 
angle for an object of radius equal to 20 m and using 4 parallel 
processes. The height of a tower is considered as well into the 
calculations.  

<br> <div class="code"><pre> 
g.region raster=Synthetic_valley 
r.survey points=Two_viewpoints dem=Synthetic_valley output=example maxdist=3000 buildingsmap=Tower buildingsheigh=Altitude object_radius=20 nprocs=4 
</pre></div> 

<h3>Filter output by a view angle threshold</h3>  
This example shows how to run <em>r.survey</em> calculating the same layers as in example 
1, but this time the outputs are filtered by a View Angle threshold of 
100 degrees. 

<br> 
<div class="code"><pre> 
g.region raster=Synthetic_valley 
r.survey points=Two_viewpoints dem=Synthetic_valley output=example2 maxdist=3000 buildingsmap=Tower buildingsheigh=Altitude object_radius=20 nprocs=4 viewangle_threshold=100 
</pre></div>  

<h3>Using r.survey in flight mode and with the downward view</h3>  

This example shows how to run <em>r.survey</em> in flight mode and with the downward view.
The observation points correspond for the path of an UAV flying in a irregular height above
the ground. A field with the points altitude information (above de sea level) is mandatory.
