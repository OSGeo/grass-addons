<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p><em>r.learn.predict</em> performs the prediction phase of a machine learning workflow. The user
  is required to load a prefitted scikit-learn estimator using the <em>load_model</em> parameter,
  which can be developed using the <em>r.learn.train</em> module, or can represent any fitted
  scikit-learn compatible estimator that is pickled to a file. The GRASS GIS imagery group to apply
  the model is set using the <em>group</em> parameter.</p>

<h2>NOTES</h2>

<p><em>r.learn.predict</em> is designed to keep system memory requirements relatively low. For this
  purpose, the rasters are read from the disk row-by-row, using the RasterRow method in PyGRASS.
  This however does not represent an efficient volume of data to pass to the classifiers, which are
  mostly multithreaded. Instead, groups of rows as passed to the estimator. The <em>chunksize</em>
  parameter represents the maximum memory size (in MB) for each of these blocks of data. Note that
  the module will consume more memory than this, especially if the estimator model was trained using
  multiple cores.</p>

<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>

<p>Here we are going to use the GRASS GIS sample North Carolina data set as a basis to perform a
  landsat classification. We are going to classify a Landsat 7 scene from 2000, using training
  information from an older (1996) land cover dataset.</p>

<p>Landsat 7 (2000) bands 7,4,2 color composite example:</p>
<center>

</center>

<p>Note that this example must be run in the "landsat" mapset of the North Carolina sample data
  set location.</p>

<p>First, we are going to generate some training pixels from an older (1996) land cover
  classification:</p>

<div class="code">
  <pre>
g.region raster=landclass96 -p
r.random input=landclass96 npoints=1000 raster=training_pixels
</pre>
</div>

<p>Then we can use these training pixels to perform a classification on the more recently obtained
  landsat 7 image:</p>

<div class="code">
  <pre>
# train a random forest classification model using r.learn.train
r.learn.train group=lsat7_2000 training_map=training_pixels \
  model_name=RandomForestClassifier n_estimators=500 save_model=rf_model.gz

# perform prediction using r.learn.predict
r.learn.predict group=lsat7_2000 load_model=rf_model.gz output=rf_classification

# check raster categories - they are automatically applied to the classification output
r.category rf_classification

# copy color scheme from landclass training map to result
r.colors rf_classification raster=training_pixels
</pre>
</div>

<p>Random forest classification result:</p>
