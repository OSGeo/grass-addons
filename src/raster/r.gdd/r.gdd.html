<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.gdd</em> calculates (accumulated) growing degree days
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growing_degree-day">GDDs</a>), 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winkler_index">Winkler indices</a>,
Biologically Effective Degree Days (BEDD), and
Huglin indices from several input maps with temperature data for different 
times of the day.
<p>
<b>GDDs</b> are calculated as
<div class="code"><pre>
    gdd = average - baseline
</pre></div>
<p>
The <b>Winkler index</b> is calculated as
<div class="code"><pre>
    wi = average - baseline
</pre></div>
usually accumulated for the period April 1<sup>st</sup> to October 
31<sup>st</sup> (northern hemisphere) or the period October 
1<sup>st</sup> to April 30<sup>th</sup> 
(southern hemisphere).
<p>
<b>BEDDs</b> are calculated as
<div class="code"><pre>
    bedd = average - baseline
</pre></div>
with an optional upper <em>cutoff</em> applied to the average. Vine 
development kinetics for example reach a plateau at an average daily 
temperature of 19&deg;C.
<p>
The <b>Huglin heliothermal index</b> is calculated as
<div class="code"><pre>
    hi = (average + max) / 2 - baseline
</pre></div>
usually accumulated for the period April 1<sup>st</sup> to September 
30<sup>th</sup> (northern hemisphere) or the period September 
1<sup>st</sup> to April 30<sup>th</sup> (southern hemisphere).
<p>
Any averages above the <em>cutoff</em> value are set to 
<em>cutoff</em>, and any <em>average</em> values below the 
<em>baseline</em> value are set to <em>baseline</em>. Negative results 
are set to 0 (zero). 
<p>
The <em>shift</em> and <em>scale</em> values are applied directly to the 
input values. The <em>baseline</em>, <em>cutoff</em>, and <em>range</em> 
options are applied to the shifted and scaled values.
<p>
If an existing map is provided with the <em>add</em> option, the 
values of this map are added to the output, thus accumulating the 
selected index.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

The <em>scale</em> and <em>shift</em> parameters are used to transform 
input values with
<div class="code"><pre>
    new = old * scale + shift
</pre></div>
<p>
With the <em>-n</em> flag, any cell for which any of the 
corresponding input cells are NULL is automatically set to NULL 
(NULL propagation) and the index is not calculated.
<p>
Without the <em>-n</em> flag, all non-NULL cells are used to 
calculate the selected index.
<p>
If the <em>range=</em> option is given, any values which fall outside 
that range will be treated as if they were NULL. Note that the range is 
applied to the scaled and shifted input data. The <em>range</em> 
parameter can be set to <em>low,high</em> thresholds: 
values outside of this range are treated as NULL (i.e., they will be 
ignored by most aggregates, or will cause the result to be NULL if -n 
is given). The <em>low,high</em> thresholds are floating point, so use 
<em>-inf</em> or <em>inf</em> for a single threshold (e.g., 
<em>range=0,inf</em> to ignore negative values, or 
<em>range=-inf,-200.4</em> to ignore values above -200.4).
<p>
The number of raster maps to be processed is given by the limit of the 
operating system. For example, both the hard and soft limits are 
typically 1024. The soft limit can be changed with e.g. 
<tt>ulimit -n 1500</tt> (UNIX-based operating systems) but not higher 
than the hard limit. If it is too low, you can as superuser add an 
entry in

<div class="code"><pre>
/etc/security/limits.conf
# &lt;domain&gt;      &lt;type&gt;  &lt;item&gt;         &lt;value&gt;
your_username  hard    nofile          1500
</pre></div>

This would raise the hard limit to 1500 file. Be warned that more
files open need more RAM.

<p>
Use the <em>file</em> option to analyze large amount of raster maps 
without hitting open files limit and the size limit of command line 
arguments. The computation is slower than the <em>input</em> option 
method. For every sinlge row in the output map(s) all input maps are 
opened and closed. The amount of RAM will rise linear with the 
number of specified input maps. The input and file options are 
mutually exclusive. Input is a text file with a new line separated 
list of raster map names.

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

Example with MODIS Land Surface Temperature, transforming values from 
Kelvin * 50 to degrees Celsius:
<div class="code"><pre>
r.gdd in=MOD11A1.Day,MOD11A1.Night,MYD11A1.Day,MYD11A1.Night out=MCD11A1.GDD \
      scale=0.02 shift=-273.15 baseline=10 cutoff=30
</pre></div>
