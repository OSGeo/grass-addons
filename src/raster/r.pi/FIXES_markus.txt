Hi authors,

I have made a series of fixes.

major stuff
- added r.pi.corrwin r.pi.index r.pi.rectangle to this copy in Dropbox for completion
- renamed since caps letters are undesired:
   r.fragment.NN -> r.fragment.nn
   r.fragment.ENN -> r.fragment.enn
- corrected all global variable definitions, in order to make code
  compilable with these flags: -Wall  -fno-common -fexceptions (a test
  for code portability)
- fixed include file order: first system, then grass includes
- use M_PI instead of private PI definition
- use GNAME_MAX instead of 256 chars length
- mv man_pages/rpi_overview.html description.html
  in order to autogenerate main description page
- updated ./description.html
   - all HTML tags should be minor case, not caps
   - linked modules
   - broken long lines

minor stuff
- added GRASS GPL header in all main.c files, PURPOSE field yet to be compiled
- fixed file permissions
- fixed main Makefile
- removed empty directories and cruft
- removed superfluous */makeit.sh files. For compilation, simply use
   make MODULE_TOPDIR=$HOME/grass64/
   make MODULE_TOPDIR=$HOME/grass64/ install
 and
   make MODULE_TOPDIR=$HOME/grass64/ clean
- fixed C code layout with this helper script:
   grass64/tools/grass_indent.sh
