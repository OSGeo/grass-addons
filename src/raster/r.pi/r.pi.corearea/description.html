<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

Edge effects and core area analysis of landcover fragments. This module can compute static edge effects (defined edge depth) and dynamic edge effects (based on surrounding landscape). The impact of the surrounding landscape can be accounted for and the resulting core area is provided.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

This module is generating core areas based on defined edge depths. The edge depths can be increased by the values of a <em>costmap</em> (e.g. urban areas could have a more severe impact than secondary forest on forest fragments). Moreover a friction map (<em> propmap</em> within the fragments can lower the impact of surrounding landcover types and hence an increased edge depth (e.g. a river or escarpment which might lower the edge effects). Moreover a <em> dist_weight</em> can be assigned in order to increase the weight of closer pixel values.

<h3>Distance weight</h3>

The assigned distance weight is computed as:<br>
w(d) = 1 - (d / d_max)^(tan(dist_weight * 0.5 * pi))<br>

where:<br>

d = Distance of the respective cell
d_max - the defined maximum distance
dist_weight - the parameter how to weight the pixel values in the landscape depending on the distance <br>

the <em>dist_weight</em> has a range between 0 and 1 and results in:<br>

0 < dist_weight < 0.5: the weighting curve decreases at low distances to the fragment and lowers to a weight of 0 at d=d_max <br>

dist_weight = 0.5: linear decrease of weight until weight of 0 at d = d_max <br>

0.5 < dist_weight < 1: the weighting curve decreases slowly at low distances and approaches weight value of 0 at higher distances from the fragment, the weight value 0 is reached at d = d_max <br>

dist_weight = 1: no distance weight applied, common static edge depth used



<h3>propmap</h3>

The <em>propmap</em> minimizes the effect of the edge depth and the surrounding matrix. This has an ecological application if certain landscape features inside a e.g. forest fragment hamper the human impact (edge effects). <br>

two method exist:<br>

propmethod=linear: propagated value = actual value - (propmap value at this position)<br>
propmethod=exponential: propagated value = actual value / (propmap value at this position) <br>

If 0 is chosen using the linear method, then propagated value=actual value which results in a buffering of the whole region. In order to minimize the impact the value must be larger than 1. For the exponential method a value of below 1 should not be chosen, otherwise it will be propagated infinitely.



<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>

An example for the North Carolina sample dataset using class 5 (forest):

For the computation of variable edge effects a costmap is necessary which need to be defined by the user. Higher costs are resulting in higher edge depths:
<div class="code"><pre>
# class - type - costs
#   1	- developed - 3
#   2	- agriculture - 2
#   3	- herbaceous - 1
#   4	- shrubland - 1
#   5	- forest - 0
#   6	- water - 0
#   7	- sediment - 0

r.mapcalc "costmap_for_corearea = if(landclass96==1,3,if(landclass96==2,2,if(landclass96==3,1,if(landclass96==4,1,if(landclass96==5,0,if(landclass96==6,0,if(landclass96==7,0)))))))"

</pre></div>


now the edge depth and the resulting core area can be computed:
<div class="code"><pre>
r.pi.corearea input=landclass96 costmap=costmap_for_corearea  output=landcover96_corearea keyval=5 buffer=5 distance=5 angle=90 stats=average propmethod=linear
</pre></div>


the results consist of 2 files:
landclass96_corearea: the actual resulting core areas
landclass96_corearea_map: a map showing the edge depths
