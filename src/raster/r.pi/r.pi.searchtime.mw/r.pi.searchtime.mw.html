<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

Analysis of landscape connectivity using individual-based dispersal 
model inside a moving window.

This module provides information about the patch connectivity within a 
moving window.


<h2>NOTES</h2>

The suitability matrix impacts the step direction of individuals. If 
individuals are moving beyond the mapset borders the indivuals are set 
back to their original source patches.

<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>

An example for the North Carolina sample dataset:

The patch relevance concerning connectivity are based on patches of the 
<em>landclass96</em> raster class 5 amd the time (amount of steps) from 
emigration to immigration is computed. The step length is set to 5 
pixel, the output statistics are set to <em>average</em> time and 
<em>variance</em> of searchtime. For each patch 1000 individuals were 
released and the model stopped when at least 80% of all individuals 
sucessfully immigrated. The command below is computing the time for the 
whole landscape and the result is prompted to the screen<br>
<div class="code"><pre>
r.pi.searchtime.mw input=landclass96 output=searchtime_mw1 keyval=5 step_length=5 stats=average,variance percent=80 n=1000
</pre></div>

for a graphical output a moving window size needs to be defined (here 
7x7 pixel) and the amount of steps until immigration per moving window 
is provided in the output raster:
<div class="code"><pre>
r.pi.searchtime.mw input=landclass96 output=searchtime_mw1 keyval=5 step_length=5 stats=average,variance percent=80 n=1000 size=7
</pre></div>


setting the perception range to 10 pixel:
<div class="code"><pre>
r.pi.searchtime.mw input=landclass96 output=searchtime_mw1 keyval=5 step_length=5 stats=average,variance percent=80 n=1000 size=7 perception=10
</pre></div>

increasing the attraction to move towards patches to 10:
<div class="code"><pre>
r.pi.searchtime.mw input=landclass96 output=searchtime_mw1 keyval=5 step_length=5 stats=average,variance percent=80 n=1000 size=7 multiplicator=10
</pre></div>

the previous examples assumed a homogeneous matrix, a heterogenous 
matrix can be included using a raster file which values are taken as 
costs for movement (0-100):
<div class="code"><pre>
# it is assumed that our species is a forest species and cannot move 
# through water, hence a cost of 100, does not like urban areas (class: 
# 6, cost: 10) but can disperse through shrubland (class 4, cost=1) 
# better than through grassland (class 3, cost: 2):
r.mapcalc "suit_raster = if(landclass96==5,1,if(landclass96 == 1, 10, if (landclass96==3,2, if(landclass96==4,1,if(landclass96==6,100)))))"
r.pi.searchtime.mw input=landclass96 output=searchtime1 keyval=5 step_length=5 stats=average,variance percent=80 n=1000 size=7 suitability=suit_raster
</pre></div>
