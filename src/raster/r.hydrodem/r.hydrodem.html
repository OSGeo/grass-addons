<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.hydrodem</em> applies hydrological conditioning (sink removal) to
a required input <em>elevation</em> map. If the conditioned elevation
map is going to be used as input elevation for <em>r.watershed</em>,
only small sinks should be removed and the amount of modifications
restricted with the <b>mod</b> option. For other modules such as
<em>r.terraflow</em> or third-party software, full sink removal is
recommended.

<h2>OPTIONS</h2>

<dl>
<dt><b>input</b>

<dd>Input map, required: Digital elevation model to be corrected. Gaps
in the elevation map that are located within the area of interest should
be filled beforehand, e.g. with <em>r.fillnulls</em> or
<em>r.resamp.bspline</em>, to avoid distortions.
<p>
<dt><b>output</b>
<dd>Output map, required: Hydrologically conditioned digital elevation
model. By default, only minor modifications are done and not all sinks
are removed.
<p>
<dt><b>size</b>
<dd>All sinks of up to <b>size</b> cells will be removed.
Default is 4, if in doubt, decrease and not increase.
<p>
<dt><b>mod</b>
<dd>All sinks will be removed that require not more than <b>mod</b>
cells to be modifed. Often, rather large sinks can be removed by
carving through only few cells. Default is 4, if in doubt, increase
and not decrease.
<p>
<dt><b>-a</b>
<dd><b>Not recommended if input for <em>r.watershed</em> is generated.</b>
<br>
With the <b>-a</b> flag set, all sinks will be removed using an impact
reduction approach based on Lindsay &amp; Creed (2005). The output will be a
depression-less digital elevation model, suitable for e.g.
<em>r.terraflow</em> or other hydrological analyses that require a
depression-less DEM as input.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

This module is designed for <em>r.watershed</em> with the purpose to
slightly denoise a DEM prior to analysis. First, all one-cell peaks and
pits are removed, then the actual hydrological corrections are applied.
In most cases, the removal of one-cell extrema could already be
sufficient to improve <em>r.watershed</em> results in difficult terrain,
particularly nearly flat areas.
<p>
The impact reduction algorithm used by <em>r.hydrodem</em> is based on
Lindsay &amp; Creed (2005), with some additional checks for
hydrological consistency. With complete sink removal, results of
<em>r.terraflow</em> are very similar to results of <em>r.watershed</em>.
<p>
<em>r.hydrodem</em> uses the same method to determine drainage directions
like <em>r.watershed</em>.
