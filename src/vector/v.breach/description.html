<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

The <em>out_ln</em> vector map contains all input <em>vect</em> lines segmented so that each line goes per one input <em>rast</em> cell per one input <em>vect</em> line. Line directions are preserved. There are 2 layers in <em>out_ln</em>.
<p>
Categories in layer 1 of the <em>out_ln</em> lines are unchanged compared to <em>vect</em>. In layer 2, each line has a unique category. These categories increase at a step of 1 along each input line, down the input line direction. Following attributes are stored for each line in layer 2:
<p>
<b>lcat</b>	- category of the input <em>vect</em> line <br>
<b>z</b>	- original elevation of the <em>rast</em> cell under the given <em>out_ln</em> line <br>
<b>z_breach</b>	- elevation of the <em>rast</em> cell under the given <em>out_ln</em> line <b>breached</b>, so that the elevation gradient down the watercourse is assured; <b>minus</b> additional <em>depth</em> specified <br>
<p>
The <b>z_breach</b> is calculated in a following way: One line from the <em>vect</em> input is processed at a time. It is divided into segments, one per each input <em>rast</em> cell it flows through. Segments are being read down the line direction. If the elevation of the cell under the current segment >= elevation of the previous cell, the elevation of the line segment = the elevation of the previous cell - 0.000001 m. Otherwise, the elevation of the current segment = the elevation of the current cell. 0.000001 is the lowest value possible to use, because GRASS database modules round down everything beyond 6 decimal places (at least <em>v.db.select</em> and <em>db.execute</em> used in the script do).
<p>
There is one point in the <em>out_pt</em> per one <em>out_ln</em> line. Categories in layer 1 and 2 of <em>out_pt</em> are identical to the cats of the closest <em>out_ln</em> line. Points are located in the middles of <em>out_ln</em> lines, except the first and last point of the given cat in layer 1, which are located, respectively, at the beginning and at the end of the given input <em>vect</em> line. For this reason, where 2 or more input <em>vect</em> lines are connected, the same number of points lie on each other. Attributes stored are the same as in the layer 2 of <em>out_ln</em>, plus:
<p>
<b>along</b>	- the distance from the starting node of the given input <em>vect</em> line <br>
<b>x</b>	- X coordinate <br>
<b>y</b>	- Y coordinate
<p>
The <em>out_pt</em>'s <b>z_breach</b> attribute can be used as an aid in creating a hydrologically sound DEM. However, mind the multiple, identically located points at the connections between the input <em>vect</em> lines, and the multiple points per one input <em>rast</em> cell in case when 2 or more <em>vect</em> lines flow through a given cell.
<p>
In the 1st case, as the <b>z_breach</b> attribute of the <b>duplicates</b> is <b>identical</b> anyway, you might want to have only one of the points (eg. if your interpolation program can't handle duplicate input points). To remove duplicates use <em>v.clean tool=rmdupl</em>. To assess the latter case, you will need to modify your input <em>vect</em> so that max one stream flows through any <em>rast</em> cell, or increase the resolution of your input DEM so that it meets the level of detail in your input drainage network.
<p>

<h2>NOTES</h2>

<ul>
  1. <em>v.breach</em> is a Bash and Awk script. Requires GRASS 6.x.<br>
  <p>
  2. The script was developed for a <b>metric</b> coordinate system, but I suppose it should work in a feet (or other unit) based system as well, only it *might* require a few modifications in parts where it directly refers to meters. It won't work in lat/lon locations though for sure, without serious modifications. Summarising, candidate troublemakers in the script might be:
  <p>
  r.buffer distances= <br>
  v.parallel distance= <br>
  v.distance <br>
  v.to.db option=length <br>
  v.to.db option=coor <br>
  v.segment <br>
  sort -n <br>
  all the Awk maths <br>
  <p>
  3. Each input <em>vect</em> line must have a <b>unique</b> category in <b>layer 1</b>. Use <em>v.category</em> to add categories, if needed.
  <p>
  4. An input line must not cross itself. Otherwise the script will go into an infinite loop.
  <p>
  5. For the same reason, any input lines must not constitute a loop.
  <p>
  6. Any of the input <em>vect</em> lines must not stand out of the input <em>rast</em> DEM.
  <p>
  7. The input DEM must have rectangular cells.
<p>
  8. Input lines direction is the key. Use <em>v.flip</em> from GRASS AddOns to flip any if needed.
</ul>
