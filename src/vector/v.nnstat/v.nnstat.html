<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.nnstat</em> indicates clusters, separations or random distribution of point dataset in 2D or 3D space using Nearest Neighbour Analysis (NNA). The method is based on comparison of observed average distance between the nearest neighbours and the distance which would be expected if points in the dataset are distributed randomly. More detailed information about theoretical background is provided in (<a href="https://courses.washington.edu/bio480/Week1-PAPER-Clark_and_Evans1954.pdf">Clark and Evans, 1954</a>), (<a href="http://journals.aps.org/rmp/pdf/10.1103/RevModPhys.15.1">Chandrasekhar, 1943, p. 86-87</a>). Details about the module and testing are summarized in (<a href="http://geoinformatics.fsv.cvut.cz/pdf/geoinformatics-fce-ctu-2013-11.pdf">Stopkova, 2013</a>).

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>
<h3>Comparison of 2D and 3D NNA</h3>
On the example of dataset that contains 2000 randomly distributed points, basic settings of analysis dimension (2D or 3D) will be examined:
<ul>
<li> <b>2D NNA</b> may be performed using <b>2D vector layer</b>. If 2D NNA is required to be
performed using <b>3D vector layer</b>, <u>flag <i>-2</i></u> should be marked. The results of
both cases can be seen below.

<div class="code"><pre>
v.nnstat input=rand_2000_2d
</pre></div>

Output in the command line:
<table>
	<tr>
		<td>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> Comparing the results of 2D NNA with results summarized in
(<a href="http://geoinformatics.fsv.cvut.cz/pdf/geoinformatics-fce-ctu-2013-11.pdf">Stopkova, 2013</a>), there can be
seen small difference between the values of area. It is assumed to be caused by differences in transformed coordinates of
the convex hull that have been computed using two versions of the module.

<li> <b>3D NNA</b> can be performed just using <b>3D vector layer</b>. If 3D NNA is required to be performed using
<b>2D vector layer</b>, <u>name of the column in attribute table that contains elevation values</u> must be set.
The results of both cases can be seen below.

<li> <b>Warning</b>: If flag <i>-2</i> is set up together with <i>zcolumn</i>, the flag will have higher priority and 2D NNA will be performed.
