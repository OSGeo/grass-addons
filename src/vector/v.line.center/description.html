<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.line.center</em> creates an <b>output</b> vector map which contains the
same number of vector points as there are in the <b>input</b> map, with each point
located in the middle of the lenght of an input vector line, if he line
has a category in the <b>layer</b> of the input map.

<p>
Points in the <b>output</b> vector map have categories only in layer 1. Their category
numbers match those of input vector lines.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

<ul>
1. Requires GRASS 6.x.<br>
2. Only input lines with categories are processed. Categories must be unique. If they
are not, the script will print warnings like "Unable to get point on line" and will
produce rubbish.
Use <b>v.category</b> to adjust category assignment first, if needed.
</ul>
