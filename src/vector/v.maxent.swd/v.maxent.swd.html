<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.maxent.swd</em> Produce a set of SWD files as input to MaxEnt 
3.3.3k+, based on a point vector layer(s) of species distribution(s), a 
point layer with background points and user-defined raster layers. The 
user can also let the function create the background point file. 
(respecting region and mask, if set).

<p>
The SWD file format is a simple CSV-like file format as described 
in Elith et al. 2011. The first three fields provide the species name, 
x-coordinate and y-coordinate, while subsequent fields contain the 
values of the user-selected environmental parameters. Note that the 
coordinates are not used by the MaxEnt program if all environmental 
data is given in the SWD format file.

<p>
The user can provide one or more species point files, which will be 
combined in one SWD file. The map names of both the species point 
layers and the environmental parameters can be replaced by alias names, 
which will be used by MaxEnt.

<p>
If alias names are used, a CSV file (alias_file) can be created with 
alias names in the first column and map names in the second column, 
separated by comma, without header. This can be used as input in 
r.maxent.lambdas (but note that this addon does not seem to work with 
outputs from Maxent 3.4+).

<h2>NOTES</h2>

The SWD output files are simple comma delimited text
files (.csv) and can therefore be easily read in in for example R
and subsequently used in other models / functions.

<p>
Maxent expects the raster cells to be perfectly square. I.e., the n-s 
and e-w resolution need to be the same. v.maxent.swd will fail if this 
is not the case. If this happens, you should change the resolution.

<p>
Following the grass gis convention, the resolution of an exported 
raster is determined by the region settings. So make sure to set the 
resolution of the region so that the n-s and e-w resolution match. To 
accomplish this, you can use (replaced the *** for the desired 
resolution):

<div class="code"><pre>
g.region -a res=***
</pre></div>

<p>
Alternatively, you can set the <i>-e flag</i>. This will run g.region 
for you, adjusting the resolution so both the ns and ew resolutionn 
match the smallest of the two, using nearest neighbor resampling.

<p>
This addon is a vector based alternative to <em>r.out.maxent_swd</em>. 
It can be more efficient with sparse data points. The main difference 
is that with this addon you can have more than one sample point per 
raster cell. points per raster cell. If this is not desired, use 
r.out.maxent_swd. Another difference is the option to export the 
predictor raster layers to a user-defined folder. This can be used in 
Maxent, Maxnet addon for R or other software.
