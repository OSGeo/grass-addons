<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.net.salesman.opt</em> estimates the optimal route to visit nodes 
on a vector network and optionally tries to improve the result.

<p>Costs may be either line lengths, or attributes saved in a database 
table. These attribute values are taken as costs of whole segments, not 
as costs to traverse a length unit (e.g. meter) of the segment. 
For example, if the speed limit is 100 km / h, the cost to traverse a 
10 km long road segment must be calculated as 
length / speed = 10 km / (100 km/h) = 0.1 h.
Supported are cost assignments for arcs, 
and also different costs for both directions of a vector line. 
For areas, costs will be calculated along boundary lines.
<p>The input vector needs to be prepared with <em>v.net operation=connect</em> 
in order to connect points representing center nodes to the network.

<p>Points specified by category must be exactly on network nodes, and the 
input vector map needs to be prepared with <em>v.net operation=connect</em>.

<h3>Optimization</h3>
For less than 10 nodes, the initial result is usually very close to the 
shortest possible tour and further optimization will have no effect.
<p>
<em>v.net.salesman.opt</em> uses the same heuristics like 
<em>v.net.salesman.opt</em> to find a good tour which is not necessarily 
the optimal tour. The tour can be optimized with two methods: 
bootstrapping and genetic algorithm (GA). The bootstrapping method 
removes a subtour from the tour and reinserts the nodes resulting in a 
shorter tour. This is applied on intermediate tours and the final tour.
<p> 
The genetic algorithm first creates several initial tours. From these 
tours nearly identical toursare eliminated. The remaining tours are 
recombined to create new, better tours. All tours are now mutated. The 
sequence of Selection, Recombination, Mutation is repeated until 
there is no better solution. Finally, the best tour is optimized with 
bootstrapping.

<h2>NOTES</h2>
Arcs can be closed using cost = -1. 

<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>

Visiting all 167 schools (North Carolina):

<div class="code"><pre>
# North Carolina

# prepare network by connecting schools to streets
v.net -c input=streets_wake points=schools_wake output=streets_schools \
  operation=connect alayer=1 nlayer=2 thresh=1000

# verify data preparation
v.category in=streets_schools op=report
# type       count        min        max
# point          6          1          6

# find the shortest path
v.net.salesman.opt in=streets_schools ccats=1-167 out=schools_tour

# Resulting tour length: 551551.662

# find the shortest path, optimize with genetic algorithm
v.net.salesman.opt in=streets_schools ccats=1-167 out=schools_tour_ga method=ga

# Resulting tour length: 521191.083
# The original tour was 5.8% longer

# find the shortest path, optimize with bootstrapping
v.net.salesman.opt in=streets_schools ccats=1-167 out=schools_tour_bs method=bs

# Resulting tour length: 510693.965
# The original tour was 8.0% longer
