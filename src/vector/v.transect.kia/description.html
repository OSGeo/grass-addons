<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.transect.kia.sh</em> calculates Kilometric Abundance Indexes (KIA) from
a point vector representing sightings along a survey transect and a line vector representing transect paths. Both vectors are usually recorded in the field using a GPS.<br>
Basically, a KIA is evaluated as<br><br>
<center>KIA = sum(objects recorded along transect) / transect length</center>

<h2>NOTES</h2>
<em>v.transect.kia.sh</em> needs <tt>sqlite</tt> as a database backend. Make sure that your GRASS installation has been compiled with <tt>sqlite</tt> support. If the current database connection already uses <tt>sqlite</tt>, the existing connection will be used. On the contrary, a temporary <tt>sqlite</tt> connection will be created and used. Previous non-sqlite database connection will be restored at script end.

<p>
Both paths and waypoints maps must contain in their attribute table a field with the same name and type (<b>idfield</b>), containing transect unique identifiers. This field will be used to assign each waypoint to the transect along which it has been recorded. Automatic assignment e.g. based on the nearest transect will be implemented in the future,

<h3>Weighted KIA</h3>
In case of different kinds of signs, e.g. accounting for different number of individuals and/or different importance in defining a species' presence, waypoints can be diversified by adding a <em>type</em> field and using it with a <em>weight table</em>. In this case a <em>weighted KIA</em> will be calculated as:<br><br>
<center>KIA = sum(object recorded along transect * object type weight) / transect length</center>
<p>
A <em>weight table</em> is a plain ASCII text file containing weight definitions, one per row, formatted as <em>type code( type code...) = weight</em>.<br>
Two special cases are possible, i.e. use <em>N</em> or </em>Q</em> (uppercase!) as weights: if <em>weight = N</em>, values contained in the <em>cluster size field</em> <b>nfield</b> will be used as weights (and a field name present in the waypoints map must be specified as value for the <b>nfield</b> parameter). If <em>weight = Q</em> will be used, <b>nfield</b> must be supplied as well, and four classes, weighting respectively 1, 2, 3, and 4 will be automatically constructed, grouping <b>nfield</b> values by quartiles.<br>
A sample <em>weight table</em> could be as follows:
<div class="code"><pre>
A CO I P PE S U = 1
C = Q 
</pre></div>
I.e., waypoints of type <em>A</em>, <em>CO</em>, <em>I</em>, <em>P</em>, <em>PE</em>, <em>S</em> and <em>U</em> will count "1", whereas <em>C</em> type waypoint will be count as 1, 2, 3,or 4 after a reclassification of <b>nfield</b> values into quartiles.

<h3>Stratified KIA</h3>
It is often needed to calculate "partial" KIAs, splitting each path by habitat types or elevation ranges (e.g. to check whether any differences in abundance exist on different habitat types or at different elevations). This is achieved supplying a polygon vector that classifies the area covered by paths. The program assumes that the GRASS vector map specified as <b>groups</b> parameter contains a field (either numeric or textual) named <em>class</em> with class codes for each polygon. If the field has a different name, use the <b>class</b> parameter.
<p>
If stratified KIAs are calculated, be warned that the process is significantly longer than other KIA calculations, since <tt>v.overlay</tt> has to be called repeatedly to break each path. It is known that <tt>v.overlay</tt> is slow, and even if called appropriately in couple with <tt>v.select</tt> or setting a region as small as possible, calculation time could increase appreciably.

<h3>3D correction</h3>
In the case of transect in montane areas, the effective path length could be underestimated and should be corrected by draping paths on a digital elevation model. This is achieved using the <b>elev</b> parameter and supplying a DEM at a siutable resolution. The DEM must be prepared in advance.


<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

<h3>Calculate plain KIA</h3>
A shapefile will be procuced, containing KIA values, directly from waypoints and tracks shapefile downloaded from a GPS unit.

<div class="code"><pre>
v.transect.kia -s paths=tracks.shp waypoints=wypts.shp output=kia.shp
</pre></div>

<h3>KIA by elevation ranges, 3D corrected</h3>
Paths will be split based on a vector derived from a DEM (with <em>r.reclass</em> plus <em>r.to.vect</em>), which classifies the study area into 200 m wide elevation ranges.

<div class="code"><pre>
v.transect.kia paths=tracks waypoints=sightings output=kia-200m elev=srtm90 groups=elev200m class=height
</pre></div>
