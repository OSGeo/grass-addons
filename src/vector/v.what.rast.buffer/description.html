<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

This purpose of this module is to provide local environmental context to a
series of vector points.
<p>
v.what.rast or r.what + coordinate alone may return a spike in the raster data
without you knowing. What this script does is create a buffer around each
vector point and gather some stats about the raster cells nearby and
report them in a .csv table. Multiple raster maps can be sampled.
It assumes the location is not lat/lon, and (in column names) that units
will be meters. (r.buffer would be lat/lon safe; but I used r.circle
because it allows starting from an exact coord not from the nearest cell)
<p>
v.rast.stats + v.buffer is problematic when input points' buffers overlap.
<p>
To speed up processing the working region is temporarily zoomed to a small
area around each point. This will align the temporary region to the raster
map's resolution and thus assumes that the raster map's region and resolution
line up with each other.

<div class="code"><pre>
# Spearfish dataset
