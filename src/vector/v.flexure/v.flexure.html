<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.flexure</em> computes how the rigid outer shell of a planet deforms elastically in response to surface-normal loads by solving equations for plate bending. This phenomenon is known as "flexural isostasy" and can be useful in cases of glacier/ice-cap/ice-sheet loading, sedimentary basin filling, mountain belt growth, volcano emplacement, sea-level change, and other geologic processes. <em>v.flexure</em> and <a href="r.flexure.html">r.flexure</a> are the GRASS GIS interfaces to the the model <a href=http://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/Model:gFlex><b>gFlex</b></a>.

As both <em>v.flexure</em> and <a href="r.flexure.html">r.flexure</a> are interfaces to gFlex, this must be downloaded and installed. The most recent versions of <b>gFlex</b> are available from <a href=https://github.com/awickert/gFlex>https://github.com/awickert/gFlex</a>, and installation instructions are avaliable on that page via the <em>README.md</em> file.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

<b>input</b> is a vector points file containing the loads in units of force. Typically, this will be a representation of a distributed field of loads as a set of points, so the user will implicitly include the area over which a stress (vertical load) acts into the quantities in the database table of <b>input</b>.
<p>
<b>te</b>, written in standard text as T<sub>e</sub>, is the lithospheric elastic thickness.
<p>
<b>output</b> is provided as a grid of vector points corresponding to the GRASS region when this command is invoked. Be sure to use <em>g.region</em> to properly set the input region! <b>raster_output</b> is the same output, except converted to a raster grid at the same resolution as the current computational region. If you have a grid spacing that is much smaller than a flexural wavelength, it is possible to interpolate the vector output to a much finer resolution than this raster output provides.
<p>
The <a href="http://csdms.colorado.edu">Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System</a>, into which <b>gFlex</b> is integrated, is a community-driven effort to build an open-source modeling infrastructure for Earth-surface processes.
