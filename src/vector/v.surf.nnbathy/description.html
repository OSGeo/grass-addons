<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.surf.nnbathy</em> is an Bourne Shell and Awk script. It is an
interface between the external <em>nnbathy</em> utility and <em>GRASS</em>.
<em>nnbathy</em> is a surface interpolation program provided with
<a href="https://code.google.com/p/nn-c/">nn</a> - a natural neighbor
interpolation library, written by Pavel Sakov.

<p>
<em>v.surf.nnbathy</em> provides 3 interpolation algorithms. According to
<em>nn</em> library documentation these are: Delaunay interpolation
(<b>alg=l</b>), Watson's algortithm for Sibson natural neighbor
interpolation (<b>alg=nn</b>) and Belikov and Semenov's algorithm for
non-Sibsonian natural neighbor interpolation (<b>alg=ns</b>). For performing
the underlaying Delaunay triangulation in all cases <em>nnbathy</em> uses
<em>triangle</em> software by
<a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/">Jonathan Richard Shewchuk</a>.

<p>
The <b>output</b> raster map is a continous surface interpolated from the
<b>input</b> or <b>file</b> data.


<h2>NOTES</h2>

<em>nnbathy</em>, if built with '-DNN_SERIAL' (default as of nn 1.85), is
able to create a grid of virtually any size. It interpolates and writes one
output point at a time only. This eliminates the necessity to hold the whole
output array in memory. However, even then all the input points are still
held in the memory.

<p>

<ul>
1. Requires <em>GRASS</em> 6 and <em>nnbathy</em> 1.76 or greater.<br>

2. Build <em>nnbathy</em> according to instructions provided with its source
code and put it somewhere in your $PATH.<br>

3. The output raster map extent and resolution match the region settings at
which the script was started.<br>

4. The output raster map non-NULL area is limited to the convex hull
encompassing all the non-NULL input cells.<br>

5. The output is double precision floating point raster map (DCELL).<br>

6. Natural neighbor is a an <em>exact</em> interpolation algorithm, so all
non-NULL input points have their value exactly preserved in the output.<br>

7. There is circa 0.2 KB memory overhead per each <em>input</em> cell.
However, the <em>output</em> grid can be of any size, if <em>nnbathy</em> is
built with -DNN_SERIAL switch.<br>

8. <em>v.surf.nnbathy</em> creates 3 temporary files: ASCII x,y,z lists of
the input points and output cells, and the output list converted into GRASS ASCII
format. Then it makes a GRASS raster map from the latter - and only then it
removes the 3 temp files, when the script terminates. Thus, at the script
run time several times more disk space might be required, than the final
GRASS raster map would actually occupy.<br>
</ul>
