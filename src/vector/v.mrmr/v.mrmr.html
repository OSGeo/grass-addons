<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em><b>v.mrmr</b></em> is a simple GUI for exporting data to the Minimum
Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR) feature selection command line tool
(Peng et al., 2005). mRMR is designed to select features that have the
maximal statistical "dependency" on the classification variable, while
simultaneously minimizing the redundancy among the selected features.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

<p>The command line tool needs to be installed separately in a location
that is recognized by the system or in the PATH. The command line tool
can be installed on windows (binaries available), linux and OS X (needs
compilation). Installation instructions are provided on <a
href="http://home.penglab.com/proj/mRMR/">Peng's Website</a>.

<p>The module requires data within a vector attribute table to be
arranged in a specific order. The classification variable (i.e., class
labels) need to be in the first column, except for the cat attribute
which is not exported. The class label also needs to be in numerical
form, i.e., 1, 2, 3.... rather than 'forest' or 'urban'. Also, the
attribute table should not contain any missing values because this
causes an erroneous mRMR result.

<p>The algorithm outputs a tab-separated list of attributes, ranked by
the most important feature first. The <i> method </i> parameter allows a
choice between the Maximum Information Difference (MID) and Mutual
Information Quotient (MIQ) feature evaluation criteria, which
respectively represent the relevancy and redundancy of the features. The
algorithm also shows the ranking of the features based on the
conventional maximum relevance method. Additional user options include
<i>nfeatures</i> which specifies the number of features that you want to
select; <i>nsamples</i> limits the maximum number of samples to base the
feature selection, and <i>maxvar</i> limits the maximum number of
attributes, both of which can therefore reduce the computation for very
large datasets. <i>threshold</i> is the discretization threshold to
apply to the continuous variable data, i.e., mean +/- threshold *
standard deviation. <i> layer </i> is the attribute layer to be used in
the feature selection process.
