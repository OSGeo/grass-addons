<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<i>v.in.ovl</i> imports vector data from an ASCII OVL file
into a (lat lon/EPS:4326) GRASS location. <br>
If no parameters are provided, <i>v.in.ovl</i> will ask for the input file
and the name of the vector layer to be created.
<br>
An OVL file can contain multiple vector geometries, such as polygons, lines
and several varieties of point data with specific attributes (different
icons, text, size, orientation).
<br>
All geometries of the OVL are imported into the GRASS vector layer. All OVL
attributes (colors, size, orientation, text, etc.) are stored in the vectors
database table.

<h2>Notes</h2>

This script will not work on binary OVL files. Make sure that ASCII OVL
is exported.
<br>
OVL files can be created from german TOP[10|25|50|100] products, Austrian
AUSTRIA MAP products and the Swiss SWISSMAP 100.
<p>
The script automatically converts the line-end characters from MS-Windows to
UN*X-style. 

<h2>Extended Mapping Opportunity</h2>

It might be interesting to know that the SWISSMAP 100 CDROM includes a
general map (low res) of central Europe which allows to create OVLs also for
parts of France, Italy and other countries.
