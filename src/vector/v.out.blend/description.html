<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.out.blend</em> was written
towards <a href="http://blender.org">Blender</A> 3d computer graphics
software users. Regarding geographic data, accessing the capabilities
of such software might be very helpful to produce high quality
outputs, and rewarding for the data producer... but transferring
digital data from GRASS to Blender is a bit tricky.</p><p>This addon
aims at exporting to Blender a 3d pointcloud (figuring eg topographic
data), previously turned into a triangular mesh. Optionally one can
export a raster as an image which can further be draped on this
surface. As usual it is quite rough but the annotated code should be
easily adaptable to one's personnal needs.

<p>
To run properly <em>v.out.blend</em> needs ParaView and its ParaView
python client (pvpython) to be installed on your system.

<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>

This command generates a Stanford 3d mesh named <tt>MyMesh.ply</tt>,
and a tiff image named <tt>ortho.tif</tt>, on the <tt>~/Desktop</tt>
directory :

<div class="code"><pre>
v.out.blend vinput=MyMesh rinput=ortho dsn="~/Desktop"
</pre><div>
