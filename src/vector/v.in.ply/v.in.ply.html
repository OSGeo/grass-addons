<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.in.ply</em> imports a vector map in PLY vector format. A PLY 
file always holds a number of vertices which are imported as points. PLY 
vertices can have a number of properties in addition to their 
coordinates. These properties are stored in an attribute table. For 
larger PLY files with many vertices (&gt; 1000) it is highly recommended 
to not use DBF as database driver, but SQLite (default in GRASS GIS 7),
PostgreSQL or MySQL, because the DBF driver is rather slow and can
consume a lot of memory. The database driver can be set with <em>db.connect</em>.

<h2>NOTES</h2>
<em>v.in.ply</em> is designed for large point clouds with the
possibility to have only coordinates, and no attribute table (for speed
reasons).

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

<div class="code"><pre>
v.in.ply input=myfile.ply output=myfile
</pre></div>
