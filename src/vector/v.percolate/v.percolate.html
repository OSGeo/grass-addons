<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.percolate</em> implements continuum percolation analysis.  It
identifies clusters of point locations at multiple threshold distances
and outputs various statistics into plain text CSV files.  See notes
for the difference between <em>v.percolate</em>
and <em>v.cluster</em>.

<p>For each input point in an input vector map <em>v.percolate</em>
outputs the following information at each threshdold distance:

<dl>
  <dt><code>Cat</code></dt>
  <dd>Cat value.</dd>
  <dt><code>&lt;fieldname&gt;</code></dt>
  <dd>The ID of the point in a chosen field in the input vector map.</dd>
  <dt><code>X</code></dt>
  <dd>X coordinate (easting).</dd>
  <dt><code>Y</code></dt>
  <dd>Y coordinate (northing).</dd>
  <dt><code>Membership</code></dt>
  <dd>Cluster membership (cluster ID).</dd>
  <dt><code>FirstChange</code></dt>
  <dd>Iteration at which the point first joined a cluster.</dd>
  <dt><code>LastChange</code></dt>
  <dd>Iteration at which the point most recently joined a new cluster.</dd>
  <dt><code>NChanges</code></dt>
  <dd>Number of changes of cluster membership.</dd>
  <dt><code>FirstDistance</code></dt>
  <dd>Distance at which the point first joined a cluster.</dd>
  <dt><code>LastDistance</code></dt>
  <dd>Distance at which the point most recently joined a new cluster.</dd>
  <dt><code>MaxConCoeff</code></dt>
  <dd> Maximum connection coefficient obtained.</dd>
  <dt><code>LastGroupConnected</code></dt>
  <dd>The cluster ID of the most recently connected cluster (the point
  itself may not have changed clusters)</dd>
  <dt><code>LastDistanceConnection</code></dt>
  <dd>Distance at which the most recently connected cluster joined
  (the point itself may not have changed clusters)) </dd>
</dl>

<p>For each cluster formed or already in existence at each threshold
distance <em>v.percolate</em> outputs:

<dl>
  <dt><code>Cluster</code></dt>
  <dd>The cluster ID.</dd>
  <dt><code>Birth</code></dt>
  <dd>Iteration at which the cluster was formed.</dd>
  <dt><code>BirthDist</code></dt>
  <dd>Distance at which the cluster was formed.</dd>
  <dt><code>Death</code></dt>
  <dd>Iteration at which the cluster was absorbed into another cluster
  and so ceased to exist as an independent entity.</dd>
  <dt><code>DeathDist</code></dt>
  <dd>Distance at which the cluster was absorbed into another cluster
  and so ceased to exist as an independent entity.</dd>
  <dt><code>Longevity</code></dt>
  <dd>Number of iterations during which the cluster existed as an
  independent entity.</dd>
  <dt><code>MaxSize</code></dt>
  <dd>The number of points in the cluster just before it was absorbed
  into another cluster.</dd>
  <dt><code>Wins</code></dt>
  <dd>The number of occasions when this cluster continued to exist
  after joining with another cluster because, depending on the rule
  chosen, it was either the larger cluster or the older cluster.</dd>
</dl>

<p>In addition to identifying clusters, <em>v.percolate</em> also
computes an <i>experimental</i> Connection Coefficient for each
point location.  This numerical value is intended to capture a
property roughly analogous to Betweeness Centrality in network
analysis.  The Connection Coefficient is smaller if a point location
joins 2 small clusters, or 1 large and 1 small cluster, and greater if
it joins 2 large clusters.

<p>By default, the series of distance thresholds at which the above
statistics will be reported is determined by
setting <b>min</b>, <b>inc</b> and <b>max</b>.  <em>v.percolate</em>
will never proceed beyond the maximum distance threshold, but it may
cease to provide output before that distance is reached if
the <b>-e</b> flag is set to force termination once all input points
are connected in one cluster.

<p>If <b>interval</b> is set to a positive non-zero value
then <em>v.percolate</em> no longer outputs statistics at fixed
distance thresholds.  Instead, it outputs statistics for
every <em>N</em>th node-pair that is joined in a cluster,
where <em>N</em> is the value given as the <b>interval</b>.  In
general this is less useful than the default behaviour, but it has
application for certain purposes.

<p>The value of <b>keep</b> determines what happens when two clusters,
each of 2 or more points, are to be joined.  The choice is between
absorbing the more recently formed cluster into the older cluster, or
absorbing the smaller cluster into the large cluster.
Setting <b>keep</b> to 'oldest' makes it possible to track the gradual
growth of one large super-cluster, but that is not necessarily most
appropriate if the location of the first cluster is of no real
significance.


<h2>NOTES</h2>

<em>v.cluster</em> already provides several methods for partitioning a
set of points into clusters and will be more appropriate for most
purposes.

<p><em>v.percolate</em> has a very specific purpose, which is to
facilitate continuum percolation analysis of point locations, as for
example described in Arcaute et al. 2016.  The emphasis of this form
of analysis is less on finding optimal partitioning of points into
clusters of certain sizes and more on observing discontinuities in
cluster growth for the purpose of identifying 'natural' sales of
interaction.  Thus <em>v.percolate</em> automates the reasonably
efficient production and recording of clusters at multiple threshold
distances.  For example, on a 2018 mid-range laptop
computer <em>v.percolate</em> requires around 100 seconds user time to
find clusters in 10,513 points (55,256,328 pairwise relationships) at
128 different distance thresholds.  Since the results will almost
certainly be subject to further analysis in other software, such
as <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a>, a range of information
(as described above) is output into plain text CSV files.

<p>Note that <em>v.percolate</em> offers only one method of
clustering, which is based purely on threshold distance: if 2 points
are closer than the threshold distance then they are joined in a
cluster.  This method will return the same clusters as
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBSCAN">DBSCAN</a> method if
one relaxes the latter's requirement for clusters to include a minimum
number of points.  As a result, clusters created
using <em>v.percolate</em> can be joined together by long strings of
points, each with only 2 neighbours within the given threshold
difference, a situation which DBSCAN avoids.
