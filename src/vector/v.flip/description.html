<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.flip</em> is a Bourne Shell and Awk script. The <b>output</b> vector map contains all lines that have a category in the given <b>layer</b> of the <b>input</b> vector map. Lines specified in <b>cat</b> have their direction flipped.

<p>
The input layer number and category numbers are preserved in the output. If a datatable is attatched to the input vector map's layer, it will be copied under the output vector map's name and connected to the output vector map, in the same database where the input layer's table is stored.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

<ul>
  1. Requires GRASS 6.x.<br>
  2. <b>Newer GRASS 6.x versions provide <em>tool=flip</em> in <em>v.edit</em>. Use it instead. It's faster, more reliable and supported by core developers.</b></br>
  2. Only lines with categories will be flipped. Use <b>v.category</b> to adjust category assignment first, if needed.
</ul>

<em>v.flip</em> was tested only in <em>metric</em> Locations. I can't guarantee it will work properly
in <em>latlong</em> or <em>unprojected xy</em> Locations, as <B>v.clean</B> is used internally
with a fixed snapping distance of <B><em>0.0001</em></B> for connecting flipped and non-flipped lines.
