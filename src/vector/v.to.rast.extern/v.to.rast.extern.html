<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.to.rast.extern</em> transforms an external vector file (like 
GeoPackage) into a raster file and import this into GRASS GIS. 


<p>
When you have a vector file that you want to convert to a raster layer, 
you would normally import the vector layer in GRASS GIS using, e.g., 
<em>v.in.ogr</em>, and subsequently convert the resulting vector layer 
to a raster layer using <em>v.to.rast</em>. Because of the topological 
vector format of GRASS, importing large vector layers can be slow. If 
all you want is to have a raster layer based on a vector layer, it may 
therefore be faster to first convert the vector layer to a raster layer 
using an external tool like <a 
href="https://gdal.org/api/python/utilities.html#osgeo.gdal.Rasterize">gdal.rasterize</a>. 
This is what this addon does; it converts the user-defined vector file 
to an intermediate geoTIF file using gdal, and import the resulting 
file in GRASS GIS. 

<p>
To illustrate the potential time saving; importing a vector layer with 
53624 buildings in my city ('s-Hertogenbosch) and converting it to a 
raster took about 35 + 2 seconds. Converting and importing the vector 
layer as raster layer with <em>v.to.rast.extern</em> took 6 seconds.


<h2>Notes</h2>

By default, <em>v.to.rast.extern</em> will only affect data in areas 
lying inside the boundaries of the current geographic region. Before 
running the function, the user should therefore ensure that the current 
geographic region is correctly set, and that the region resolution is at 
the desired level. Alternatively, the user can use the <b>-v</b> flag 
to import the whole vector layer. To ensure 
that the resulting raster layer  cleanly aligns with the computational 
region, the extent may be slightly larger than that of the vector 
layer.

<p>
If the coordination reference system (CRS) of the vector file differs 
from that of the mapset in which you want to import the raster, the 
vector file will first be reprojected using <em>ogr2ogr</em>.

<p>
By default, the object in the vector layer will be assigned a value of 
<i>1</i> in the resulting raster layer. The user can change this value 
using the <b>value</b> parameter. Alternatively, the user can specify 
the name of an existing column from the vector map's attribute table. 
In that case, the values in that column will be used as raster values 
in the output raster map.

<p>
With the <b>-d</b> flag, all pixels touched by lines or polygons will 
be updated, not just those on the line render path, or whose center 
point is within the polygon. For lines, this is similar to setting the 
<i>-d</i> flag in <em>v.to.rast</em>.

<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>

The examples of <em>v.to.rast.extern</em> use vector layers from the 
(<a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/download/data/">North Carolina sample 
data set</a>). 

<h3>Example 1</h3>

First, export a vector layer as a GeoPackage. 

<div class="code"><pre>
# Export the geology vector layer as Geopackage
v.out.ogr input=geology@PERMANENT output=geology.gpkg format=GPKG
</pre></div>

<p>
Import the geology.gpkg as raster. Raster cells overlapping with the 
vector features will be assigned a value of 1, and the other raster 
cells Nodata. If you have RAM to spare, increase the memory to speed up 
the import.

<div class="code"><pre>
# Set the region
g.region -a vector=geology res=500

# Import the layer
v.to.rast.extern input=geology.gpkg \
output=geology_rast \
memory=20000
</pre></div>

<div align="left" style="margin: 10px"> <a 
href="v_to_rast_extern_im01.png"> <img src="v_to_rast_extern_im01.png" 
alt="The geology vector file converted to, and imported as raster in 
GRASS. Example 1" border="0"> </a><br><i>Figure 1: The geology vector file was 
converted to, and imported as a raster in GRASS, using the default 
settings.</i> </div>

<p>
Note that if you have a GeoPackage (or any other data source) with 
multiple layers, you need to specify which layer you want to use with 
the <b>layer</b> parameter. If you do not, the first layer will be 
selected. 

<h3>Example 2</h3>

Import the geology.gpkg as raster. Specify the column of the attribute 
table that holds the values you would like to use as raster values. 

<div class="code"><pre>
# Import the layer
v.to.rast.extern input=geology.gpkg \
output=geology_rast2 \
attribute_column=GEOL250_ \
memory=2000

# Assign random colors
r.colors map=geology_rast2 color=random
</pre></div>

href="v_to_rast_extern_im02.png"> <img src="v_to_rast_extern_im02.png" 
alt="The geology vector file converted to, and imported as raster in 
GRASS. Example 2" border="0"> </a><br><i>Figure 2: The geology vector file

the values from the attribute column GEOL250_.</i> </div>


<h3>Example 3</h3>

First, set the resolution to 1 meter. Next, export the busroute6 vector 
layer as GeoPackage, and import it as a raster layer. Use the <b>-v</b> 
flag to ensure the extent of the raster layer matches that of the 
vector layer (by default, the bounding box of the raster layer will 
match that of the current computation region).

<div class="code"><pre>
# Set the resolution to 1 m
g.region -a res=1	

# Export the busrout6 vector layer
v.out.ogr input=busroute6@PERMANENT \
type=line \
output=busroute6.gpkg \
format=GPKG

# Import it as raster layer, using the extent of the vector layer
v.to.rast.extern input=busroute6.gpkg \
output=busroute6_1 \
memory=2000 -v
</pre></div>

<div align="left" style="margin: 10px"> <a 
href="v_to_rast_extern_im03.png"> <img src="v_to_rast_extern_im03.png" 
alt="The busroute6 vector file converted to, and imported as raster in 
GRASS. Example 1" border="0"> </a><br><i>Figure 3: The busroute6 vector file 
converted to, and imported as raster in GRASS, using the default 
parameter settings.</i> </div>


<h3>Example 4</h3>

The same as above, but using the <b>-d</b> flag to create densified 
lines.

<div class="code"><pre>
# Import it as a raster layer, using the extent of the vector layer
v.to.rast.extern input=busroute6.gpkg \
output=busroute6_2 \
memory=2000 -v -d
</pre></div>

alt="The busroute6 vector file converted to, and imported as raster in
