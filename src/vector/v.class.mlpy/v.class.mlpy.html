<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>
The <em>v.class.mlpy</em> module is a tool for supervised vector classification.
It is built on top of the Python <em>mlpy</em> library [Albanese2012].
The classification is based on attribute values. The geometry is not taken into
account, so the module does not depend on the feature types used in the map.
The classification is supervised, so the training dataset is always required.

<p>
The attribute table of training map (dataset) has to contain a column with
the class. Required type of class column is integer. Expected type of other
columns is double or integer.


<h2>NOTES</h2>

<p>
This module requires the user to have <em>mlpy</em> library installed.
However, this is not an issue because <em>mlpy</em> library is
free and open source and can be quickly downloaded and installed.
Furthermore, library is available for all major platforms supported by
GRASS GIS. You find <em>mlpy</em> download and installation
instructions at the official <em>mlpy</em> website
(<a href="http://mlpy.sourceforge.net/">http://mlpy.sourceforge.net/</a>).


<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>

<p>
This is an example in a North Carolina sample dataset. It uses several
raster maps and generates (spatially) random vector data for classification
from raster maps. The random data used as input to
the classification and represent training dataset and dataset to be classified
in the real use case.

<p>
Two sets of random points are generated containing 100 and 1000 points.
Then, an attribute table is created for both maps and attributes are derived
from digital values of raster maps (Landsat images) at points locations.
These attribute table columns are input to the classification.
The smaller dataset is used as training dataset. Classes are taken from
the raster map which is a part of the sample dataset as an example result
of some former classification. The number of classes in training dataset is 6.
