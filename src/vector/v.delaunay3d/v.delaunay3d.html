<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.delaunay3d</em> performs 3D Delaunay triangulation on input 3D
vector point map. Resultant facets (ie. triangles) of tetrahedral
network (TEN) are written as faces to the output vector
map. If <b>-l</b> flag is given, the module writes edges of the
network as lines instead of faces.

By <b>-p</b> flag the user can perform plain 3D triangulation instead
of Delaunay triangulation. In the plain triangulation the facets
depends on the insertion order of the vertices.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

3D triangulation is performed
by the <a href="http://www.cgal.org">CGAL</a> library.

<p>
Centroids are treated as points when reading data from the input
vector map. Note that input vector map must be 3D, the output is
always 3D.

<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>

<div class="code"><pre>
# generate random 3D points
v.random out=rp n=100 zmax=100 -z
# perform 3D triangulation
v.delaunay3d input=rp output=rp_ten
...
Number of vertices: 100
Number of edges: 626
Number of triangles: 1019
Number of tetrahedrons: 492
</pre></div>
