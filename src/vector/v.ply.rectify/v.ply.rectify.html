<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.ply.rectify</em> imports a PLY point cloud, georeferences and
exports it. The first three vertex properties must be the x, y, z
coordinates with property names &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;,
&quot;z&quot;, in this order.
<p>
A text file with Ground Control Points (GCPs) must exist in
the same folder where the point cloud is located, and the textfile must
have the same name like the point cloud, but ending on .txt instead of
.ply.
<p>
The text file with GCPs must have the following format with one GCP per line:
<div class="code"><pre>
  x y z east north height status
</pre></div>
with <em>x, y, z</em> as source coordinates and <em>east, north, height</em>
as target coordinates. The <em>status</em> indicates whether to use a GCP
(status is not zero) or not (status is zero). Entries must be separated
by whitespace or tabs. Decimal delimiters must be points.
<p>
The georecitifictation method used is a 3D orthogonal rectification
where angles are preserved. 3D objects are shifted, scaled and rotated,
but no shear is introduced. Please read the output of the module, in
particular the root mean square (RMS) errors.
<p>
<em>v.ply.rectify</em> optionally exports the georeferenced point cloud
not only with real coordinates, but also with shifted coordinates
(<em>-s</em> flag) for display in meshlab or similar software that can
not deal with real coordinates. The exported PLY point clouds will be in
the same folder like the input PLY point cloud.

<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>

With a point cloud file <em>pointcloud.ply</em> and associated control
points in <em>pointcloud.txt</em>,

<div class="code"><pre>
v.ply.rectify -s input=pointcloud.ply
</pre></div>

will generate three files: <em>pointcloud_georef.ply</em> with the
georeferenced point cloud, <em>pointcloud_georef_shifted.ply</em> with
the georeferenced point cloud shifted to the coordinates' center, and
<em>pointcloud_rms.csv</em> with the RMS errors of the control points.
