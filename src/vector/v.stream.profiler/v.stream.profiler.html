<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.stream.profiler</em> builds and exports plots and data sets of river long profiles, slope-accumulation (e.g., slope-area), and more for topographic analysis. It currently works only in a downstream-directed walk, for a single channel, from the chosen segment until the downstream-most point in the network.

It takes in the adjacency structure supplied by <a href="v.stream.network">v.stream.network</a>.
