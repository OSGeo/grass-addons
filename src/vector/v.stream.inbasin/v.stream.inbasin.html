<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.stream.inbasin</em> uses the output of v.stream.network to select only those streams (and sub-basins) that are upstream of (and inclusive of) a selected link in the network. It is used as a step to develop GSFLOW model inputs for a watershed, but need not be exclusively used for that purpose.
