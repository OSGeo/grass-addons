<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.rast.move</em> takes values from raster maps and adds them to X and Y
coordinates of features in a vector map vertex by vertex. Works on lines
only, other features are ignored and not included in the result.

Null values in rasters are turned into zeros by default and a warning is
generated. This behavior can be modified by the <b>nulls</b> option to
either silence the warning with explicit <code>nulls="zeros"</code>
or the warning can be turned into an error with <code>nulls="error"</code>.

The rasters are loaded based on the computational region, so the most
advantageous use of resources is to set the computational region to
match the vector. To avoid issues with vector coordinates at the border
of the computational region, it is best to also grow the region one cell
on each side. Vector features outside of the computational region always
result in an error being reported (regardless of the <b>nulls</b> option),
but the rasters can have any extent as along as the computational region
is set to match the vector.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

Unlike <em>v.perturb</em> which moves points randomly, <em>v.rast.move</em>
works on vertices of lines and uses same value for all vertices at a given
cell. Unlike v.transform used with raster values in attribute columns,
<em>v.rast.move</em> operates on individual vertices in the line, not on the
whole line (attributes are associated with features, not their vertices).

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

<h3>Shift in X direction</h3>

<!-- The original code is in the notebook. -->

This example uses the North Carolina sample dataset.

Set the computational region to match the vector map and use
100-meter resolution.

<div class="code"><pre>
g.region vector=roadsmajor res=100
</pre></div>

Generate rasters for a shift in X direction (one raster is a wave, the other is zero):

<div class="code"><pre>
g.region vector=roadsmajor res=100
r.mapcalc expression="a = 1000 * sin(row())"
r.mapcalc expression="b = 0"
</pre></div>

Use the rasters to move the vector:

<div class="code"><pre>
v.rast.move input=roadsmajor output=roads_moved x_raster=a y_raster=b
</pre></div>
