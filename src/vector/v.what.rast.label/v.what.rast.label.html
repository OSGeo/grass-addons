<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.what.rast.label</em> retrieves raster values and labels from one
or more given raster maps for each point stored in the input vector map.
The name of the columns with the raster values and labels are
respectively<i>ID_name-of-raster-map</i> and <i>name-of-raster-map</i>.

<p>Optionally, the user can define raster layers without labels. In that case
only raster values are uploaded to a column with the name
<i>name-of-raster-map</i>. 

<p>Except the columns with raster values, the attribute table of the
output vector point map can optionally include columns with coordinates.

<p>The user can opt to include the attribute columns of the input vector layer
in the output. In that case, the columns with the raster values and labels will
appear after the columns from the input vector layer.
    
<h2>NOTES</h2>

Points and centroids with shared category number cannot be processed. To solve 
this, unique categories may be added with v.category in a separate layer. See
<i>v.what.rast</i> for details.

<p>If you only want to upload raster values at positions of vector points to the
attribute table of that vector layer, use <i>v.what.rast</i> instead.
