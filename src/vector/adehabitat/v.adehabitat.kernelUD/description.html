<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p><em>v.adehabitat.kernelUD</em> is used to estimate the utilization distribution (UD)
of animals monitored by radio-tracking, with the classical kernel
method.</p>

<p>The Utilization Distribution (UD) is the bivariate function giving
the probability density that an animal is found at a point
according to its geographical coordinates.  Using this model, one
can define  the home range as the minimum area in which an animal
has some specified probability of being located. The module v.adehabitat.kernelUD 
correspond to the approach described in Worton (1995).</p>

<p>The kernel method has been recommended by many authors for the
estimation of the utilization distribution (e.g. Worton, 1989,
1995). The default method for the estimation of the smoothing
parameter is the <em>ad hoc</em> method, i.e. for a bivariate normal
kernel: h = Sigma*n^(-1/6), where Sigma = 0.5*(sd(x)+sd(y)), which supposes 
that the UD is bivariate normal.</p>

<p> Alternatively, the smoothing parameter h may be computed by
Least Square Cross Validation (LSCV).  The estimated value then
minimizes the Mean Integrated Square Error (MISE), i.e. the difference
in volume between the true UD and the estimated UD.  Note
that the cross-validation criterion cannot be minimized in 
some cases (indicated by "convergence: no" by the module).  
According to Seaman and Powell (1998) <em>"This is a difficult problem
that has not been worked out by statistical theoreticians, so no
definitive response is available at this time"</em>
(see Seaman and Powell, 1998 for further details and tricky solutions). 

<p>The flag -r returns the UD so that the contour of the equal value of the 
UD displayed by the module r.contour corresponds to the different
percentage levels of home-range estimation.</p>

<p>The results returned by this module are roughly identical to
the results of the function kernelUD of the adehabitat package for the 
R software. The only difference is related to the LSCV method: 
because the minimization of the MISE requires numerical methods, 
the smoothing parameter found by v.adehabitat.kernelUD differ slightly from 
those returned by the function kernelUD in adehabitat (the correlation 
between the two is often greater than 0.99, pers.obs.).</p>

<p>This module heavily relies on the code written by Stefano Menegon 
for his module v.kernel. It has just been extended to allow the LSCV 
and ad hoc estimation of the smoothing parameter, and the computation
of the volume under the UD for home range estimation.</p>
