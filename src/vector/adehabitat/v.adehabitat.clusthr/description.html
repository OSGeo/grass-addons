<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p><em>v.adehabitat.clusthr</em> computes the home range of one animal using 
a clustering algorithm (Kenward et al. 2001). This method has been 
"translated" for GRASS from the R function "clusthr" in the 
package adehabitat (Calenge, 2006). This method estimates
home range using a modification of single-linkage cluster analysis 
developped by Kenward et al. (2001). The clustering process is 
described hereafter: the three locations with the minimum mean 
of nearest-neighbour joining distances (NNJD) form the first cluster. 
At each step, two distances are computed: (i) the minimum mean 
NNJD between three locations (which corresponds to the next 
potential cluster) and (ii) the minimum of the NNJD between a 
cluster "c" and the closest location.  If (i) is smaller that (ii), 
another cluster is defined with these three locations. If (ii) 
is smaller than (i), the cluster "c" gains a new location.  
If this new location belong to another cluster, the two cluster fuses. 
The process stop when all relocations are assigned to the same cluster.</p>

<p>At each step of the clustering process, the proportion of all
relocations which are assigned to a cluster is computed (so that
the home range can be defined to enclose a given proportion of the
relocations at hand, i.e. to an uncomplete process). At a given
step, the home range is defined as the set of minimum convex
polygon enclosing the relocations in the clusters.</p>

<p>The user may either: (i) compute the home range at a given 
percentage: this corresponds to the set of clusters enclosing a 
given percentage of the relocations (default), (ii) compute the 
home range corresponding to a given step of the algorithm (flag -s, a 
first run of the module indicates the maximum number of steps 
supported by the data), or (iii) have a visual display of the 
whole clustering algorithm (flag -a). Note that for the first 
case (i), we may have different home range configuration for a given 
value of 'percent'. For example, if percent = 100, it is 
possible that all relocations have been assigned to one out of 
two clusters, just before the last step of the algorithm. So that the 
last step of the algorithm just consists into the "fusing" of the 
two clusters. The two choices (two clusters or one cluster)
correspond to configurations where 100% of the relocations 
are enclosed in the home range. When such 
cases happen, the module returns the configuration with the 
largest number of clusters, i.e., the minimum home range size 
(in the example, two clusters of relocations).</p>
