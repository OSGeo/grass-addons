<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

The module <i>v.stream.order </i> is designed to compute different
stream order approaches based on a stream network vector map and a water
outlet vector point map. It requires two inputs:
<ol>
    <li>A vector line map with one or several independent stream networks</li>
    <li>A vector point map that defines the water outlet points in the stream network</li>
</ol>
A single output vector map containing all detected networks and all specified orders
is generated as output.

<p>
    The direction of the stream flow will be adjusted in outlet direction and stored in the
    output vector map.<br><br>

    To determine the outlet stream network segment, a nearest neighbor search is performed.
    The threshold of the search can be adjusted with the <i>threshold</i> option.
    It is required to specify the threshold as floating point value
    that is interpreted using the locations projection unit. <br><br>

    It is required that the vector line direction of the network segment that was found
    at the outlet point, is directed to the outlet point. Since, the depth-first search
    network traversing will be performed in upstream direction. Stream networks in
    downstream direction will be detected. However, the stream order will not be computed.
    The stream order table entries will be empty. <br><br>

    The output vector map contains a column for each specified order algorithm,
    the network id, the outlet category of the vector point input map
    and the column <i>reversed</i>. The column reversed indicates if the
    stream network segment was reversed in direction to point to
    the water outlet point (0 - not reversed, 1 - reversed).<br><br>

    In addition all columns from the stream network input map
    are copied to the output vector map. The input vector map columns that
    should be copied will be automagically renamed in the output vector map, 
    if the column names are conflicting with each other. Use the <i>columns</i>
    parameter to specifiy a subset of columns that should be copied. 
    The keyword <i>all</i> is used to copy all columns to the output vector map
    that are found in the input vector map (default). 

</p>

<h2>Note</h2>
<p>
      Be aware that the stream network map must be topological correct.
      Each independent stream network must be properly connected.
      The implemented stream order algorithms rely on topological relations between lines and nodes
      and are not designed to handle loops and channels in the stream networks correctly.<br><br>
      
      The network traversing method, that is used to compute the stream order numbers,
      is recursively implemented. In case of large stream networks, or networks
      with many loops, the maximum recursion depth of Python may be reached.
      The module will stop then with an <i>maximum recursion depth exceeded</i> exception.
      This parameter can be adjusted with the <i>recursionlimit</i> option. The default in Python is 1000.
      The default in v.stream.order is 10000.
</p>

<h2>Supported stream order algorithms</h2>

The following algorithm examples are based on this stream network.
Be aware of the wrong stream directions that will be adjusted by v.stream.order.<br>

<h3>Strahler's stream order</h3>

<img src="stream_network_order_strahler.png" border="0" height="240" width="200"><br>

Strahler's stream order is a modification of Horton's streams order which fixes
the ambiguity of Horton's ordering. 
In Strahler's ordering the main channel is not determined; instead the ordering
is based on the hierarchy of tributaries. The
ordering follows these rules:
<ol>
    <li>if the node has no children, its Strahler order is 1.
    <li>if the node has one and only one tributuary with Strahler greatest order i,
    and all other tributaries have order less than i, then the order remains i.
    <li>if the node has two or more tributaries with greatest order i, then the
    Strahler order of the node is i + 1.
</ol>
Strahler's stream ordering starts in initial links which assigns order one. It
proceeds downstream. At every node it verifies that there are at least 2 equal
tributaries with maximum order. If not it continues with highest order, if yes
it increases the node's order by 1 and continues downstream with new order. 
<p>
    <b>Advantages and disadvantages of Strahler's ordering: </b>
    Strahler's stream order has a good mathematical background. All catchments with
    streams in this context are directed graphs, oriented from the root towards the
    leaves. Equivalent definition of the Strahler number of a tree is that it is the
    height of the largest complete binary tree that can be homeomorphically embedded
    into the given tree; the Strahler number of a node in a tree is equivalent to
    the height of the largest complete binary tree that can be embedded below that
    node.
</p>
<p>
    The disadvantage of that methods is the lack of distinguishing a main
    channel which may interfere with the analytical process in highly elongated
    catchments. It is not able to handle loops in the ordered graph correctly.

<h3>Shreve's stream magnitude</h3>

<img src="stream_network_order_shreve.png" border="0" height="240" width="200"><br>

That ordering method is similar to Consisted Associated Integers proposed by
Scheidegger. It assigns magnitude of 1 for every initial channel. The magnitude
of the following channel is the sum of magnitudes of its tributaries. The number
of a particular link is the number of initials which contribute to it. 

<h3>Scheidegger's stream magnitude</h3>

<img src="stream_network_order_scheidegger.png" border="0" height="240" width="200"><br>

That ordering method is similar to Shreve's stream magnitude. It assigns
magnitude of 2 for every initial channel. The magnitude of the following channel
is the sum of magnitudes of its tributaries. The number of a particular link is
the number of streams -1 contributing to it.

<h3>Drwal's stream hierarchy </h3>

<img src="stream_network_order_drwal.png" border="0" height="240" width="200"><br>

That ordering method is a compromise between Strahler ordering and Shreve
magnitude. It assigns order of 1 for every initial channel. The order of the
following channel is calculated according Strahler formula, except, that streams
which do not increase order of next channel are not lost. To increase next
channel to the higher order R+1 are require two channels of order R, or one R and
two R-1 or one R, and four R-2 or one R, one R-1 and two R-2 etc. The the order
of particular link show the possible value of Strahler'order if the network was
close to idealized binary tree. Drwal's order is computed based on
Shreve's magnitude with the formula: <b>floor(log(shreve,2))+1</b>.
<p>
    <b>Advantages and disadvantages of Drwal's hierarhy:</b>
    The main advantages of Drwal's hierarchy is that it produces natural stream
    ordering with whcich takes into advantage both ordering and magnitude. It shows
    the real impact of particular links of the network run-off. The main
    disadvantage is that it minimize bifurcation ratio of the network.
