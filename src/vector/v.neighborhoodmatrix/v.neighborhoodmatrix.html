<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.neighborhoodmatrix</em> identifies all adjacency relations between
polygons in a vector map and exports these as a 2xn matrix where n is the
number of neighborhood relations with each relation only listed in one
direction (i.e. if a is neighbor of b, the list will contain a,b, but
not b,a) unless the <em>b</em> flag is specified.
By default, neighbors are identified by the category numbers. Using the
<em>idcolumn</em> parameter the user can define a column to use as identifier
of the polygons.
If a path to an output file is specified, the matrix will be written to that
file, otherwise it will be sent to standard output.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

Currently the module assumes that the layer above the layer containing the
polygons is empty and available for adding categories to boundaries.

The module uses <em>v.to.db</em> to determine neighborhood relations.

<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>

Send the neighborhood matrix of the census tracts of the North Carolina dataset
to standard output identifying each tract by its category value:

<div class="code"><pre>
v.neighborhoodmatrix in=census_wake2000
</pre></div>

Idem, but identifying each tract by its STFID code and sending the output to a
file:

<div class="code"><pre>
v.neighborhoodmatrix in=census_wake2000 idcolumn=STFID output=census_neighbors.csv
</pre></div>
