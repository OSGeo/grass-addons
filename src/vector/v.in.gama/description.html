<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.in.gama</em> creates a GRASS vector map layer based on GNU GaMa
XML output file. This file (which contains adjustment results of
geodetic network) can be created by <em>gama-local</em> tool.

<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>

First, we adjust geodetic network by <em>gama-local</em> tool. The
adjustment results are saved also in XML data format.

<div class="code"><pre>
gama-local --xmlout network.xml network.gkf
</pre></div>

Afterwards we create a map layer <i>network</i> by the
module <em>v.in.gama</em>:

<div class="code"><pre>
v.in.gama input=network.xml output=network
</pre></div>

This map layer contains two different layers. Layer 1 is connected
with attribute table 'network_point', layer 2 with 'network_obs'. In the first
layer are stored points of geodetic network. Layer 2 contains
observation data (in geometry way lines and points).

<h2>NOTES</h2>

<b>GNU Gama</b> is a project dedicated to adjustment of geodetic
networks. GNU Gama is released under GNU General Public Licence. For
parsing XML documents GNU Gama calls <em>expat</em> parser written by James
Clark.

<p>
GNU Gama currently contains two main development branches. Stable
branch of the project is limited to network adjustment in a local
coordinate system (program <em>gama-local</em>). In the unstable development
branch the adjustment model is based on geocentric coordinate system
(program <em>gama-g3</em>).

<p>
The development version of the program <em>gama-local</em> enables
to save adjustment results besides of the standard text format also in
newly designed XML output data format. This feature is fundamental for
GRASS module <em>v.in.gama</em>. Currently it is possible to
use <em>v.in.gama</em> only in connection with
<em>gama-local</em> from unstable development branch.
