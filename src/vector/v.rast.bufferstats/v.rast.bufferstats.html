<h2>DESCRIPTION:</h2>
The purpose of the <em>v.rast.bufferstats</em> module is to provide 
local environmental context to a series of input geometries. 
It computes statistics from multiple input raster maps within multiple 
buffers around selected geometries in the input vector map.
<p>Available statistics are either</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>statistics provided by <em>r.univar</em> or</li>
<li>if the <em>t-flag</em> is checked - area of, number of and/or the most frequent (mode) raster categories 
within the buffers using <em>r.stats</em>.</li>
</ol>

<p>If <em>output</em> option is specified, results are written to file or 
stdout in stead of attribute table of the input map. 
File output is produced with the following column order:<br>
cat | prefix | buffer| statistic/measure | value<br>
separated by the user defined separator (default is |).</p>

<h2>NOTE</h2>
The module temporarily modifies the computational region. The region is set to the 
extent of the respecive buffers, while the alignement of the current region is kept.

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>
<div class="code"><pre>

g.region -p raster=elevation,geology_30m
v.clip --o -r input=bridges output=bridges_wake

# Tabulate area of land cover map
g.region -p raster=elevation,geology_30m align=geology_30m
v.rast.bufferstats -t input=bridges_wake raster=geology_30m buffers=100,250,500 column_prefix=geology

# Compute terrain statistics
g.region -p raster=elevation,geology_30m align=elevation
r.slope.aspect elevation=elevation slope=slope aspect=aspect
v.rast.bufferstats input= raster=altitude,slope,aspect buffers=100,250,500 column_prefix=altitude,slope,aspect methods=minimum,maximum,average,stddev percentile=5,95

</pre></div>

<h2>KNOWN ISSUES</h2>
In order to avoid topological issues with overlapping buffers, the module loops over the 
input geometries. However, this comes at costs with regards to performance.
For a larger number of geometries in the vector map, it can be therefore more appropriate to 
compute neighborhood statistics with <em>r.neighbors</em> and to extract (<em>v.what.rast</em>, 
<em>r.what</em>) or aggregate (<em>v.rast.stats</em>) from those maps with neighborhood statistics.

<p>
The module is affected by the following underlying library issue:
Currently, the module uses GRASS native buffering through pygrass which should be replaced by buffering using GEOS:
