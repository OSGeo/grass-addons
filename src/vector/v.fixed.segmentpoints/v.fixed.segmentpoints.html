<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.fixed.segmentpoints</em> creates segment points along a vector 
line with fixed distances by using the <em>v.segment</em> module. A 
category of one line has to be given. Start and end point of the line 
will be considered. The distance option is limited to an integer number. 
As a <em>prefix</em> (starting with a letter) has to be given, resulting 
vectors are <em>prefix</em>_singleline and 
<em>prefix</em>_segmentpoints, resulting external files are 
<em>prefix</em>_segmentpoints and <em>prefix</em>_segmentpoints.csv.
</p>

<p>
The next to last point may be closer to the last point as the given 
distance. Distance information for every point is added to the vector 
attribute table. The attribute is then exported as CSV file.
</p>

The <em>category (cat)</em> of the input line is stored in the column 
<em>cat_line</em> of the <em>prefix</em>_segmentpoints attribute table.
