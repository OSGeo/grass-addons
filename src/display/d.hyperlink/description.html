<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>d.hyperlink</em> is an interactive shell script that allows the viewing
of hyperlinked images from a vector's attribute table in an external image
viewer. Queries can be made via SQL statements or interactive mouse-clicking.
The attribute table must be pre-populated with a column containing the image
to link the vector to; the user also specifies the image folder in the
current MAPSET where the images are located. The script currently supports 
gimp, Eye of Gnome, gthumb, gpdf, and Inkscape image viewers.
