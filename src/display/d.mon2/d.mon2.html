<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

This is just a little experiment to see if we can make the ximgview,
wximgview, and wxpyimgview programs a bit simpler to start up.
<p>

Add this to your ~/.grass.bashrc file:
<pre>
  if [ `echo "$GRASS_VERSION" | cut -f1 -d.` -eq 7 ] ; then
     alias d.mon='eval `d.mon.py -b`'
  fi
</pre>

<p>
By default the temporary file will be stored in $MAPSET/.tmp/ and cleared
at the end of the session. You can put it somewhere else with the
<b>tempfile</b> option. For example, when working remotely with
PuTTY (ssh without tunnelled X) + Apache:
<pre>
   alias d.mon='eval `d.mon.py -b handler=none tempfile=/var/www/grassmap.png`'
</pre>
then just hit reload in your web browser whenever a refresh is needed.
