<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>d.anaglyph</em> creates a sterographic 3D image suitable for viewing
either with red/cyan glasses, a stereograph viewer, or unaided by simply
focusing into the distance or crossing your eyes. Vector line and point
maps may be draped over the raster surface.

<p>
Stereograms (two images side by side) will be in full color. Anaglyphs
(needing red/cyan glasses) will be in greyscale, but some colors like
yellow can be used. This module allows creation of stereograms either in
parallel or cross-eyed mode.


<h2>NOTES</h2>

The NetPBM image manipulation tools are required.
The output file will be a PNG image.

<p>
The cross-eyed flag simply flips the image pair left-for-right. If the
mountains look like valleys to you, or considerable eye strain is needed
to obtain a 3D effect, try using this flag. 3D image cognition is not
universal among individuals, some trial and error may be needed to create
an image that works well for you.


<h3>Anaglyphs</h3>

<p>
If draping a <b>color_overlay</b> raster map over the top of a DEM in
anaglyph mode, it works best to first change the color map of the overlay
raster to greyscale or sepia with the <em>r.color</em> module (perhaps
with the <b>-e</b> flag), to prevent any red/cyan in the overlay's color
table from confusing the 3D effect.

<p>
The flatten terrain and equalize contrast flags only operate in anaglyph
mode. The equalize contrast flag only applies to the base DEM and
will not have an effect if a <b>color_overlay</b> raster map is used.


<h3>Stereograms</h3>

<p>
For standard stereograms to be viewed with a stereoscopic viewer the
<b>-g</b> flag will overlay middle-of-image fiducial marks for easier
alignment.

<p>
For "free-view" stereograms, the <b>-g</b> flag helps guide your eyes by
adding instructions and two white dots to focus on. In parallel viewing
mode (the default) it will be hard to focus the dots if they are more
than the width of your eyes appart, in this case it is recommended to not
set the image <b>size</b> of each pane any greater than about 180 or 200
pixels, so the two panes look like bookmarks. The narrower the image the
easier it will be to focus on, but the less you will be able to see.

<p>
Cross-eyed free-viewing allows for observing full-width images, but it
may take a bit more practice to master the technique: hold your
finger up mid-way between your nose and the image in front of you, and
while focusing on it try to get the two images in the background to
overlap. When they do try to lock in on the central image in the
background instead of your finger without altering your eyes' focus.


<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

North Carolina dataset anaglyph:
<div class="code"><pre>
g.region rast=elevation
d.anaglyph input=elevation output=wake_anaglyph.png size=1280,960 \
   vlines=roadsmajor vpoints=schools_wake
</pre></div>


Spearfish dataset anaglyph:
<div class="code"><pre>
g.region rast=elevation.10m
d.anaglyph -e input=elevation.10m output=spearfish_anaglyph.png \
   size=1280,960 z_exag=1.5 vlines=roads vpoints=archsites
</pre></div>


Spearfish dataset free-view stereogram:
<div class="code"><pre>
g.region rast=elevation.10m
r.colors -e elevation.10m color=haxby
d.anaglyph -g input=elevation.10m output=spearfish_stereogram.png \
   style=freeview size=185,500 viewing_height=27000
</pre></div>


<h2>TODO and BUGS</h2>

Fine tuning; needs more viewpoint separation when the z-exaggeration
is high.
<br>
View is currently limited to top-down.
<br>
NVIZ ties the viewing height to the vertical exaggeration and
perspective settings, after changing the <b>z_exag</b> option you
may find you need to change the <b>viewing_height</b> option as well.
<br>
Sometimes one of the images flips (if this happens, try using the
<b>-r</b> flag or adjusting the region width).
