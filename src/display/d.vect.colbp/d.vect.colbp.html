<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>
<em>d.vect.colbp</em> draws a boxplot of the values in a vector 
<em>map</em> attribute <em>column</em>. The user can use the 
<em>where</em> option to only select a subset of the attribute table. 
There is also the option to group the values of the column according to 
the categories in a second column (<em>group_by</em> and create one plot 
with for each group a separate boxplot.

<p>
By default, the resulting plot is displayed on screen (default). 
However, the user can also save the plot to file using the 
<em>plot_output</em> option. The format is determined by the extension 
given by the user. So, if plot_output = outputfile.png, the plot will 
be saved as a png file.

<p>
There are a few additonal layout options, including the option to rotate 
the plot and the x-axis labels. Furthermore, the user can optinally plot 
the boxplot(s) with notches and without outliers.

<h2>NOTE</h2>
<p>
This script, based on d.vect.colhist, is a quick and dirty solution 
sing basic matplotlib, and will need some further fine-tuning and 
testing.

<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>

<h3>Example 1</h3>
Use the vector layer <em>schools_wake</em> from the 
<a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/download/data/">NC sample 
dataset</a> to create boxplots of the core capacity of the schools in 
Wake County, North Carolina. Use the <em>Where</em> clause to exclude 
all records with no data.

<div class="code"><pre>
d.vect.colbp -n map=schools_wake column=CORECAPACI where="CORECAPACI >0"
</pre>
</div>

<h3>Example 2</h3>
Use the vector layer <em>schools_wake</em> from the 
<a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/download/data/">NC sample 
dataset</a> to create boxplots of the core capacity of the schools in 
Wake County, North Carolina, grouped by city. Use the <em>Where</em> 
clause to exclude all records with no data. 

<div class="code">
<pre>
d.vect.colbp -h --overwrite map=schools_wake column=CORECAPACI where="CORECAPACI >0" group_by=ADDRCITY order=ascending
	</pre>
</div>
