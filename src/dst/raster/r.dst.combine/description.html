<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

This program combines evidence maps (currently GRASS floating point raster only) using <em>Dempster's
Rule of Combination</em>.
It is part of a general framework for Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) modelling with GRASS GIS.<p>

<h3>Introduction to the DST</h3>

<font size="-1">(Note: the following is a very brief introduction to DST. Many details have been 
left out to keep everything easy to understand. If you want the full mathematical background, 
refer to one of the many excellent sources on the internet that can be found by using "Dempster Shafer
Theory" as a search phrase. The original publication is: Shafer, G. (1976). A Mathematical Theory of Evidence.
Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey, USA.)</font><p></p>
Consider a standard situation in GIS-based research.
A scientist wants to build a spatial model and check its plausibility. He/she has:
<ol>
	<li>written down a number of <em>hypotheses</em>. These hypotheses include all possible outcomes of the model,
	</li>
	<li>created a number of GIS maps that encode variables (evidences) which he/she deems to be of importance for the
model,
	</li>
	<li>
	found a way to quantify the evidence.
	</li>
</ol>
For each hypothesis, our scientist would now simply like to combine all supporting evidences and calculate
the total degree of <em>belief</em> he/she can have in that hypothesis. These belief values should then
be written to GIS maps to form a spatial model.<p></p>
The mathematical framework to achieve this is provided by the <em>Dempster-Shafer Theory of Evidence</em> (DST).
To clarify things, we will need to make some definitions:<p></p>

<ul>
<li>The set of hypotheses <i>H<sub>1..n</sub></i> which represent <em>all</em> possible model outcomes is called <em>Frame of Discernment</em> (FOD).</li>
<li>A GIS map that encodes a variable with relevance to the FOD is a <em>source of evidence</em>. 
A map object (e.g. a cell in a raster map) is turned into an <em>evidence</em> through a
<em>Basic Probability Assignment (BPA)</em>.
</li>
<li>A BPA is the basic quantification of evidence in the DST.
It consists of a value <i>m<sub>n</sub></i> in the range 0 to 1 for each hypothesis in the FOD. 
The restriction is that <i>m<sub>1..n</sub></i> must sum to 1.
</li>
</ul>
BPAs can be assigned to a singleton hypothesis in <i>H</i> as well as to subsets such
as {<i>H<sub>1</sub></i>,<i>H<sub>2</sub></i>}.
What this means is that DST has the ability to represent <em>uncertainty</em> as subsets 
of <i>H</i>.
E.g. if two hypotheses <i>H<sub>1</sub></i>='a' and <i>H<sub>2</sub></i>='b' are supplied, 
then there will always also exist a set of hypotheses <i>A</i>={<i>H<sub>1</sub></i>,<i>H<sub>2</sub></i>}
to represent the belief that both could be true ('a OR b').<p></p>
Evidences from a variety of source can be combined using Dempster's Rule of Combination:

<p align="center"><img src="dst.combine.001.png" alt="BPA chart"></p>

In words: Dempster's Rule computes a measure of agreement between two sources of 
evidence for various (sets of) hypotheses
in the FOD (in the formula above: <i>A</i>,<i>B</i>,<i>C</i>). It focuses on the hypotheses which both 
sources support. The resulting BPA is calculated
by combining the BPAs of the hypotheses from both sources that yield the hypotheses of the combined
body. The result is also normalised (denominator) to ensure that it is a valid BPA.
From the BPAs, a number of useful DST functions can be calculated. The most important ones
are <em>belief</em> and <em>plausibility</em>.<p>

The <em>belief function Bel(H)</em> computes the total belief in a hypothesis (set) <i>A</i>. 
The total belief in <i>A</i> is the BPA mass
of <i>A</i> itself plus the BPA mass attached to all the subsets of (<i>B</i> in the formula
below:

<p align="center"><img src="dst.combine.002.png" alt="BPA chart"></p>

In words: <em>Bel(A)</em> is all the evidence that speaks in favour of <i>A</i>.<p>
 
DST has a very important characteristic which makes it different from probability theory: if <i>Bel(H)</i>< 1, then
the remaining evidence 1-<i>Bel(H)</i> does not necessarily refute <i>H</i> (in probability theory we would have
<i>H<sub>2</sub></i>=1-<i>H<sub>1</sub></i> if the FOD was {<i>H</i>=<i>H<sub>1</sub></i>,<i>H<sub>2</sub></i>}).
Thus, some of the remaining evidence might <em>plausibly</em> be assigned to (sets of) hypotheses that are subsets
of or include <i>A</i>. This is represented by the <em>plausibility function</em>: 

<p align="center"><img src="dst.combine.003.png" alt="BPA chart"></p>

In words: <em>Pl(A)</em> represents the maximum possible belief in <i>A</i> that could
be achieved if there was no uncertainty at all.

<h3>Program Functionality</h3>

The <em>dst.combine</em> program can be used to combine evidences from different
sources using Dempster's Rule of combination. Currently, all evidences must be
in GRASS 5 floating point raster map format. In order to turn any raster map into
an evidence map, the BPAs have to be calculated. The way to do this is totally
dependent on the model design and it is left up to the user to e.g. create a
custom <EM><A HREF="../../html/r.mapcalc.html">r.mapcalc</A></EM> script to take care of 
BPA calculations (with one exception: 
for predictive models, the <EM><A HREF="r.dst.bpa.html">r.dst.bpa</A></EM> program can be 
used).<p>
The model layout, i.e. evidences and associated hypotheses must respect some formal
mathematical restrictions. To take the burden of this from the user, all evidences
and hypotheses are stored in a special XML format element called <em>
DST knowledge base file</em> in the current working location. This file and its
contents can
be managed by using the <EM><A HREF="dst.update.html">dst.update</A></EM> command.<p> 
From the sources of evidence listed in the DST knowledge base file,
one or more of the following DST functions can
be calculated (for each hypothesis/set of hypotheses in the knowledge base file) 
and the result(s) output to a  new GRASS raster map 
(all values will be in the range 0 to 1):

<dl>
<dt><b>Belief</b></dt>
	<dd><em>Bel(A)</em> is the total belief in a hypothesis. This is the most basic DST 
	function.</dd>
<dt><b>Plausibility</b></dt>
	<dd><em>Pl(A)</em> is the maximum achievable belief given that there is no uncertainty.</dd>
<dt><b>Doubt</b></dt>
	<dd>This is simply defined as 1-<em>Pl(A)</em>.</dd>
<dt><b>Commonality</b></dt>
	<dd>(Definition missing).</dd>
<dt><b>Belief Interval</b></dt>
	<dd>Another aspect of representing uncertainty, the <em>belief interval</em> measures
	    the difference between current belief and maximum achievable belief.
	    It is defined as <em>Pl(A)-Bel(A)</em>. Areas with high values for
	    the belief interval represent "hot spots" where additional/better
	    information would improve model results.</dd>
<dt><b>Weight of Conflict</b></dt>
	<dd>If the <em>weight of conflict</em> is > 0 it indicates that evidences
	    from different sources disagree with each other. A high weight of
	    conflict might indicate a serious flaw in the model design or
	    disagreement of evidences supplied by different people.</dd>	
<dt><b>Maximum BPA</b></dt>
	<dd>This gives the maximum belief mass contributed by any of the sources of evidence.</dd>
<dt><b>Minimum BPA</b></dt>
	<dd>This gives the minimum belief mass contributed by any of the sources of evidence.</dd>
<dt><b>Maximum BPA source</b></dt>
	<dd>This identifies the source of evidence by name, which has contributed the
	    highest belief mass. It is a useful tool in combination with the
	    "maximum BPA" measure.</dd>
<dt><b>Minimum BPA source</b></dt>
	<dd>This identifies the source of evidence by name, which has contributed the
	    lowest belief mass. It is a useful tool in combination with the
	    "minimum BPA" measure.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>DST Predictive Modelling</h3>

If you have need for a flexible, raster-based spatial predictive modelling framework, DST might be 
just the right tool for you. 
In fact, this software has been developed with predictive models in mind for which the
DST approach has a number of benefits:

<ul>
<li>Simplicity: a DST predictive model can be set up in just a few steps (as outlined below).</li>
<li>Flexibility: DST has the ability to combine information from different sources, regardless
    of distribution parameters.</li>
<li>Interpretability: the functions calculated are much more meaningful than standard statistical
    metrics.</li>
<li>Efficiency: calculations are faster than statistical algorithms and the memory footprint will 
    always be very small, regardless of region extent and resolution.</li>    
</ul>

A DST predictive model may be very simple and consist of only two hypotheses for 'site' and 'no site'
(plus the combination of the two to represent uncertainty). It can be built like this:
<ol>
<li>Save your known site locations in a GRASS site list and take a random <em>sample</em> using
<EM><A HREF="v.random.sample.html">v.random.sample</A></EM>.</li>
<li>Convert all sources of evidence (coverage maps, buffer objects, height maps etc.) into evidence
raster maps using <EM><A HREF="../../html/r.categorize.html">r.categorize</A></EM> and 
<EM><A HREF="r.dst.bpa.html">r.dst.bpa</A></EM> (with the random sample).</li>
<li>Register all evidence maps and hypotheses in a DST knowledge base file using 
<EM><A HREF="dst.update.html">dst.update</A></EM> (this will automatically create all
additional uncertainty hypotheses sets).</li>
<li>Associate sources of evidence using <EM><A HREF="dst.source.html">dst.source</A></EM>.</li>
<li>Combine evidence from the sources in the knowledge base using <em>dst.combine</em>.</li>
<li>Take a look at the output maps and verify results with the <em>full</em> set of known sites
(use <EM><A HREF="v.report.html">v.report</A></EM> for convenience).</li>
</ol>
</i>NEW</i> as of version 1.5: You can now use <EM><A HREF="dst.predict.html">dst.predict</A></EM>
to create predictive models with a single, easy-to-use command!
<p>
A protocol of a GRASS command line session might look like this:
<pre>
# A predictive model of lost Maya towns in the jungle.
# (do not take serious ;)

# (point positions of known Maya towns are stored in vector map "locations")
# take a random sample of 50%
v.random.sample input=locations output=sample size=50

# Create a digital elevation raster map from height measurements.
# Turn into an integer map with categories 0-5m, 5-10m, etc.
s.surf.rst input=elevations elev=height
r.categorize input=height output=height_5m mode=width,5

# Import a vector map showing jungle vegetation coverages.
# Interactively label vegetation categories.
v.to.rast in=vegetation output=vegetation
r.support

# Create evidence maps. The idea is that Maya towns are 
# found at certain heights and in areas with specific vegetation.
r.dst.bpa raster=height_5m sites=sample output=bpa.height
r.dst.bpa raster=vegetation sites=sample output=bpa.vegetation

# Create new knowledge base file.

# Combine sources of evidence and output belief maps
# for all hypotheses.
dst.combine mayatowns sources=height,vegetation output=dst.mayatown

# Compare with the full set of sites to see how well the
# model does (most of the sites should fall into cells
# with high belief values for "SITE").
