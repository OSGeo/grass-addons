<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

With the <em>dst.view</em> command, the information in a Dempster-Shafer knowledge base file
can be printed out in a formatted, easy-to-read fashion. 
The knowledge base file is an XML format ASCII file which resides in its own 'DST' element
inside the user's current mapset.
Such a file is necessary to perform Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) calculations using 
<EM><A HREF="dst.combine.html">dst.combine </A></EM>.
If you do not know what DST is or why you would need this program, please refer to the
<EM><A HREF="dst.combine.html">dst.combine </A></EM> command's manpage for an introduction.<p>
Knowledge base files themselves can be listed, created, deleted and renamed using a special
<A HREF="dst.list.html">set of commands</A>.

<h3>Flags</h3>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-a</strong></dt>
	<dd>Show all hypotheses (including type 'AUTO'). Normally, only <em>singleton</em> hypotheses
	 supplied by the user (type 'USER') are shown. If this flag is set, then sets of hypotheses
	 that were generated automatically will also be shown, as well. See the manpage of 
	 <EM><A HREF="dst.update.html">dst.update </A></EM> for an explanation of the different
	 types.
	</dd>	
</dl>

<h3>Parameters</h3>
<dl>
<dt><B>file=</B><EM>name</EM></dt>
	<dd>Name of DST knowledge base file to view. You can get a listing of DST
		 knowledge base files in your current mapset by invoking 
		 <EM><A HREF="dst.list.html">dst.list </A></EM>. 
	</dd>
<dt><B>logfile=</B><EM>name</EM></dt>
	<dd>Specfiy a valid file name if you want the output stored in a file instead
	    of printed on the screen.
	</dd>	
</dl>	    

<h3>Notes</h3>
This program was developed as part of the GRASS 5 DST Predictive Modelling Toolkit.<br>
The term "knowledge base file" was first used in the manual of the 
<A HREF="www.clarklabs.org" target="_blank"> IDRISI GIS </A> software which also offers some DST functionality.<br>
