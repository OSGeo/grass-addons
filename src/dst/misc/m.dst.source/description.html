<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

This program is used to define sources of evidence in a Dempster-Shafer knowledge
base file. The knowledge base file is an XML format ASCII file which resides in its 
own 'DST' element inside the user's current mapset.
Such a file is necessary to perform Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) calculations using 
<EM><A HREF="dst.combine.html">dst.combine </A></EM>.
If you do not know what DST is or why you would need this program, please refer to the
<EM><A HREF="dst.combine.html">dst.combine </A></EM> command's manpage for an introduction.<p>
Although the knowlegde base file can theoretically be edited with
any ASCII editor, it is highly recommended to always use <em>dst.source</em> to make changes
regarding sources of evidence. This ensures that the mathematical structure of the model layout 
will remain intact.<p>

The <em>dst.source</em> command allows the user to define sources of evidence in a knowledge base file.
This is the last step in preparing data for a DST analysis.
To get an overview of the DST model structure and the defined sources of evidence at any time, 
use the <EM><A HREF="dst.view.html">dst.view </A></EM> command.
Knowledge base files themselves can be listed, created, deleted and renamed using a special
<A HREF="dst.list.html">set of commands</A>.<p></p>

Since hypotheses can be defined and evidences attached to them using 
<EM><A HREF="dst.update.html">dst.update </A></EM>, it may seem unnecessary to
define these relations again as 'sources of evidence'. However, the information
structure created by <EM><A HREF="dst.update.html">dst.update </A></EM> is not
necessarily unambiguous. There are no restrictions on the order in which evidences
are attached and some hypotheses may be associated with more evidences than others.
This means that it is not always clear which evidences have to be combined in one run
of <EM><A HREF="dst.combine.html">dst.combine </A></EM> and therefore another
step is necessary.
Defining sources of evidence ensures that one input to <EM><A HREF="dst.combine.html">
dst.combine </A></EM> will always consist of exactly one evidence for each hypothesis
in the frame of reference and that BPA values relating to that hypothesis will not be 
accidentally combined with hypotheses from another source.<p></p>


<h3>Parameters</h3>
<dl>
<dt><B>file=</B><EM>name</EM></dt>
	<dd>Name of DST knowledge base file to modify. You can get a listing of DST
		 knowledge base files in your current mapset by invoking 
		 <EM><A HREF="dst.list.html">dst.list </A></EM>. </dd>
<dt><B>add=</B><EM>name</EM></dt>
	<dd>Adds a source of evidence 'name' to the knowledge base. Naming conventions follow
	    the same rules as filenames.</dd>	
<dt><B>del=</B><EM>name</EM></dt>
	<dd>Deletes the evidence source 'name' from the knowledge base file.
	</dd>	
<dt><B>ren=</B><EM>name</EM></dt>
	<dd>Renames evidence source 'name'. New name must be specified using the <em>new=[name]</em>
	    parameter (see below).
	</dd>	
<dt><B>new=</B><EM>name</EM></dt>
	<dd>Specifies a new name for renaming a source of evidence.
	</dd>	
<dt><B>const=</B><EM>value</EM></dt>
	<dd>Assigns constant evidence to a source of evidence. 
	    The hypothesis (or set of hypotheses) to which this evidence relates must be 
	    specified using the <em>hypothesis=[name]</em> parameter. 
	    The target source must be specified using the <em>source=[name]</em> parameter.
	</dd>
<dt><B>rast=</B><EM>name</EM></dt>
	<dd>Assigns raster map evidence to a source of evidence.</dd>	
<dt><B>vect=</B><EM>name</EM></dt>
	<dd>Assigns vector map evidence to a source of evidence.</dd>
<dt><B>clean=</B><EM>name</EM></dt>
	<dd>Removes all assignments to a source of evidence from a hypothesis (specified using <em>hypothesis=[name]</em>).</dd>
<dt><B>prune=</B><EM>name</EM></dt>
	<dd>Removes assignments to a source of evidence from one or all hypotheses. The type(s) of
	    evidence (const,rast,vect) to un-assign can be specified using <em>type=[name]</em>.
	</dd>
<dt><B>source=</B><EM>name</EM></dt>
	<dd>Specifies source of evidence to operate on. Case matters!
	</dd>
<dt><B>hypothesis=</B><EM>name</EM></dt>
	<dd>Specifies hypothesis to operate on. Note that order matters when refering to 
	hypotheses sets: 'a,c' may exist, but 'c,a' not!
	</dd>	
<dt><B>type=</B><EM>name</EM></dt>
	<dd>Type of evidence to un-assign (use in conjunction with <em>prune=[hyp]</em>). 
		Possible options are <em>const,rast,vect,*</em>.
	</dd>	

<h2>USAGE</h2>

Refer to the section on 'Predictive Modelling' in the
manpage of the <EM><A HREF="dst.combine.html">dst.combine </A></EM> command
for an example of how to define sources of evidence using <em>dst.source</em>.
	    

<h3>Notes</h3>
This program was developed as part of the GRASS 5 DST Predictive Modelling Toolkit.<br>
The term 'knowledge base file' was first used in the manual of the 
<A HREF="www.clarklabs.org" target="_blank"> IDRISI GIS </A> software which also offers some DST functionality.<br>
