This bash script is to be used when Isis (http://astrogeology.usgs.gov) is installed on the computer, it was developed and tested with an Ubuntu 64-bit set up.

To run it:
"bash ./mk_isis_menu.sh"

It will create in your user directory:
~/.grass7/toolboxes/toolboxes.xml
~/.grass7/toolboxes/main_menu.xml
~/.grass7/toolboxes/module_tree.xml

once it has been run, launch grass 7 normally, and work with Isis and GRASS together.
