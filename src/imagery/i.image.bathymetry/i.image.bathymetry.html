<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>i.image.bathymetry</em> is used to estimate Satellite-Derived 
Bathymetry (SDB). Module estimates bathymetry over near-shore region 
using limited reference depth points. The maximum depth can be 
estimated by the module is depending up on many factors such as quality 
of the water, suspended materials etc.,(Lyzenga et al., 2006, Kanno 
and Tanaka, 2012). Our experiments with several multispectral optical 
images indicate that the depth estimates are reliable for when water 
column is below 20 meter.
<br><br>
Delineation of land and water area are based on combining the result of 
NDVI and band ratio. NDVI has used to delineate water from land, band 
ratio between green band and infrared band used to separate the 
delineated water from clouds, ice, etc. Atmospheric and water 
corrections applied according to the Lyzenga et al., 2006. Corrected 
spectral bands will be used for weighted multiple regression to 
estimate depth. R library <em>GWmodel</em> has been used to compute the 
Geographically Weighted Regression used for depth estimation.
<h2>NOTES</h2>
The input image must include deep water pixels (far away from the 
coast) which are used to assist water surface and water column 
correction.if there is no deep water pixels included in the satellite 
imagery, atmospheric and water corrections are carried without using 
deep water pixels. Sparse depth points extracted from hydrographic 
charts or depth pints derived from LiDAR survey or derived from Sonar 
survey can be used as reference depth for calibration. The calibration 
depth points provided by the user are used to ditermine the Area of 
Interest, therefore it is suggested to provide calibration depth points 
in order to cover user's estimation region boundary. In addition, an 
optional parameter is also available to provide a polygon vector 
file for user's to ditermine the area to be estimated (see first 
example).
<br><br>
The tide height at the time of reference depth collection and satellite 
imagery capture should be normalized if it is not. An  option is 
available in the module to provide tide hieght at the tide of image 
captured and the module will correct the reference depth accordingly. 
This option asuumes that the reference depth given is corrected zero 
tide height. The tide lower than zero can be added as negative value.
<br><br>
The <em>GWmodel</em> adaptive GWR model is memory intensive and may not 
be used to process large images. For large images, the estimation is 
carried out by using non-adaptive GWR implemented in <em>r.gwr</em> 
module in GRASS GIS. R > 3.1 should be installed to run 
<em>GWmodel</em> in order to proccess adaptive GWR model for better 
depth estimation. Default gaussian kernel will be used to estimate 
geographically weighted regression coefficients.The flag 'b' can be used 
to change the kernel function gaussian to bi-square.

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>
In <em>i.image.bathymetry</em> green band, red band, near-infrared 
band, band for correction and calibration depth points are mandatory 
input. Additional bands available in the visible wavelength can be used 
for better depth estimation as optional input. Short Wave Infrared 
(SWIR) band is suggested to use as "band_for_correction" if it is 
available (for e.g. satellite images like Landsat-7, Landsat-8 and 
Sentinel-2).An example of depth estimation using Sentinel-2 (MSI) image 
is shown below, where depth value is stored in column named 'Z'<br>
<div class="code"><pre>
i.image.bathymetry blue_band='B2' green_band='B3' red_band='B4' 
nir_band='B8' band_for_correction='B11' 
calibration_points='Calibration_points' calibration_column='Z' 
depth_estimate='output' area_of_interest='AOI'
</pre></div> 
<br>
If SWIR band is not available near-infrared band can be used as 
"band_for_correction" (for e.g. satellite images like RapidEye and ALOS 
AVINIR-2). An example of depth estimation using RapidEye image is shown 
below image is shown below, where depth value is stored in column named 
'value'.<br>
<div class="code"><pre>
i.image.bathymetry blue_band='B1' green_band='B2' red_band='B3' 
Additional_band1='B4' nir_band='B5' band_for_correction='B5' 
calibration_points='Calibration_points'  calibration_column='value' 
depth_estimate='output' 
</pre></div>
