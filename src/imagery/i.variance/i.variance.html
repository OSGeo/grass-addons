<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>Following the Woodcock and Strahler (1987), <em>i.variance</em> resamples 
a raster <em>input</em> layer (normally a remotely sensed image) to 
successively decreasing resolutions and calculates the mean local variance of
the entire image at each resolution. Local variance is defined as the variance
in a 3x3 window.

<p>
The modules starts at the current computing region resolution and then decreases
the resolution (increases the pixel size) by <em>step</em> until it
reaches the maximum size of pixels (aka minimum resolution) determined by
the <em>max_size</em> parameter, or when the number of total pixels falls below
<em>min_cells</em>. If both are given, <em>min_cells</em> takes precedence.

<p>
Resampling to lower resolution uses the average of higher resolution pixels.

<p>
By default, the module prints a comma separated list to stdout containing each
resolution that represents a local maximum of variance (higher variance than
the resolution before and after in the iterations) as well as the difference in
variance with the neighbor with most similar variance.

<p>
In addition, the user can choose to output the results in the form of a graph 
plotting variance against resolution (<em>plot_output</em>) either to a file
by giving a file name (its extension determines the output format) or to
the screen using '-'. The entire data of variance depending on resolution can
also be saved in a csv file using <em>csv_output</em>.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

The aim of this module is to provide diagnostics to the user about the size of
detectable "objects" in an image. This can provide helpful input to modules
that take a window size or desired object size as input, such as, for example,
<a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/r.texture.html">r.texture</a> and 
<a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/i.segment.html">i.segment</a>.

<p>
As Woodcock and Strahler (1980) write: "The reasoning
behind this measure is as follows. If the spatial resolution is 
considerably finer than the objects in the scene, most of the measurements in 
the image will be highly correlated with their neighbors and a measure of 
local variance will be low. If the objects approximate the size of the
resolution cells, then the likelihood of neighbors being similar decreases and 
the local variance rises. As the size of the resolution cells increase and many
objects are found in a single resolution cell, the local variance decreases."


<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>

<p>
The three examples based on the North Carolina demo data orthophoto show how 
different types of objects in images lead to different forms of the variance
curve with different resolutions showing peak values of variance.
