<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>
<em>i.gabor</em> computes texture raster maps from a user-specified Gabor
filter bank and raster map.
The 2 dimensional Gabor filter is an orientation sensitive filter which mimics
the cells within the human visual cortex by creating a filter bank of multiple
orientations and scales to pick up different frequency responses.
This mimicing or simulation of the visual cortex, and in particular its
sensitivity to various orientations, sets the filter aside from other standard
texture and edge detectors.
Additionally, the Gabor filter has been shown to have high localization
optimization/performance in both the spatial and frequency domains.
The localized nature of the filter then allows for the parameters to be tweaked
and changed to retrieve different features which suit the visual needs of the
analysis.
Subsequently, the Gabor filter has been used in hyperspectral image
classification, water body and river extraction, land use classification and
change detection, and is especially powerful when used with Object Based Image
Analysis (OBIA) and edge detection algorithms.


<h2>NOTES</h2>

<em>i.gabor</em> uses <a href="https://numpy.org/">NumPy</a> to handle the
entire raster map in memory.
This can result in a bottleneck when processing large raster maps.
Additionally, <a href="https://www.scipy.org/">SciPy</a> is used for fast
Fourier convolution of the each filter.

The module can either produce individual rasters with the suffix of
<b>windowsize_orientation_wavelength_offset_aspect</b> for each filter in the
bank or a single combined (<b>-c</b>) raster outputting with only the basename.

<p>
The default orientations computed will be 0 (East/West), 45
(North-East/South-West), 90 North/South, 135 (North-West/South-East).
However, the user can also specify any number of orientations in degrees less
than 180 with the <b>orientation</b> option.
The window size of the Gabor filter is specified by the user in
<em>i.gabor</em>
The standard deviation of the Gaussian kernel before it is oscillated is tied to
the user-specified window size.
<p>
The Gabor filter has both a real and imaginary component which can be used for
different purposes.
While <em>i.gabor</em> computes the real component by default, the imaginary
component can be computed by using the flag <b>-i</b>.

<p>
By default <em>i.gabor</em> outputs each Gabor filter convolved raster map as
individual raster maps
with each part corresponding to its specified value.
The <b>-c</b> flag can be used to create a singular combined raster map as the
output.
<p>
Additionally, <em>i.gabor</em> offers statistical thresholding which will set
values below a user-specified percentile (<b>threshold</b>) of the convolved
image to 0 while keeping all values above the percentile the same.
In conjunction with thresholding, a bitwise quantification (<b>-q</b>) method
is implemented for the orientations specified by the user.
As an orientation sensitive filter, the Gabor filter is unique in its
capabilities to mimic the human visual cortex system when a bank of Gabor
filters is used. Common filter banks will consist of between 4 to 8
orientations and scales controlled by the wavelength. Each filter within a bank
is subsequently convolved over the raster map for each kernel within the bank.
The resulting number of raster maps will be the number of orientations x the
number of scales.

<h3>Orientation quantification</h3>
The orientation quantificatation takes the index value (<i>i</i>) of each
user-specified orientation and applies <i>2<sup>i</sup></i> for every value
greater than or equal to the percentile value. Where a bit string position is
equal to one it indicates the corresponding orientation<i><sub>i</sub></i> has
a strong response.
<div class="code"><pre>
orientation = 0, 45, 90, 135
0   = 0b00000001 = 1
45  = 0b00000010 = 2
90  = 0b00000100 = 4
135 = 0b00001000 = 8
</pre></div>
This method will allow the values of the combined raster to be decomposed in
order to evaluate which orientations had high responses for a given raster
cell. For example, if a cell has high responses at orientations 0 and 135
degrees, the combined raster cell will have a final output value of 9, which as
a binary string is <i>0b00001001</i>.

<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>
The following example uses the North Carolina demo data orthophoto to show the
orientation responses of a Gabor filter bank. Eight orientations are used; 0,
22.5, 45, 67.5, 90, 112.5, 135, and 157.5 degrees. For the quantified raster
map, the bit values will be 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and 256.

<p>After the Gabor filter is generated, it can be used for a number of purposes.
For instance, we can create a segmented raster map of ortho_2001_t792_1m aided
with both the real and imaginary component of the Gabor filter which is able to
reduce noise in the output raster map.

<h2>TODO</h2>

More robust implementation in regard to potential bottleneck caused by treating
everything in memory. Implement GRASS RasterRow/Segment class to read in bits of
raster map at a time in memory.
