<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>i.pr.features</em> This module is used to preprocess and extract the training features. It is necessary to specify the training file, which contains the names of the raster maps (explanatory variables) to be used in subsequent modules. The training file can either be the output from from <em><a href="i.pr.training.html">i.pr.training</a></em> (Recommended) or an ascii file containing the names of rasters.  
<p>
This module allows for the calculation of a range of statistics pertaining to the explanatory variables, which include the mean and variance. In addition the features can be normalized to a similar scale. In each case, it is possible to specify the numbers of features for which these statistics should be computed (i.e. number in list). There is also the possibility to compute principal components for the explanatory variables. The default calculates them for all layers, or else only on selected classes specified by 'class_pc'. Variables can be standardised using parameter 'standardize', this is linked to the features previously calculated and not layers in the training file.
