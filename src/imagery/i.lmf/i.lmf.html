<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>i.lmf</em> calculates the Local maximum fitting of a temporal image series,
intially for vegetation indices, it also works for surface reflectance.
<p>
This is a first level port, only a fast fitting is done, see TODO.

<p>
The number of bands is potentially several years, <b>nfiles</b> and <b>ndates</b>
are respectively the number of pixels and the number of pixels in a year.

Yann Chemin and Kiyoshi Honda repaired it and ported it from SGI/OpenMP to Linux.

<h2>TODO</h2>
Port the full detailed algorithm from Fortran, and vastly unemcomber/clean it.
It will make the algorithm must slower though, gaining only a marginal fitting
strength, for my actual experience with VIs curves.
