<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>
Mask R-CNN tools allow the user to train his own model and use it for
a detection of objects, or to use a model provided by someone else. It can be
seen as a supervised classification using convolutional neural networks.

<p>
The training is done using module <em>i.ann.maskrcnn.train</em>. The user feeds
the module with training data consisting of images and masks for each instance
of intended classes, and gets a model. For difficult tasks and when not using
a pretrained model, the training may take even weeks; in case of a good
pretrained model and powerful PC with GPU support, the training could get good
results after 1 day and even less.

<p>
When the user has a model, it can be used for the detection.
<em>i.ann.maskrcnn.detect</em> detects classes learned during the training and
extracts from given images vectors corresponding to detected objects. Objects
can be extracted either as areas or points.

<h2>DEPENDENCIES</h2>

<p>
<em>i.ann.maskrcnn.*</em> modules contain a lot of external Python
dependencies. To run modules, it is necessary to have them installed. Modules
use Python3, so please install Python3 versions.

<p>
<ul>
  <li>NumPy</li>
  <li>Pillow</li>
  <li>SciPy</li>
  <li>Cython</li>
  <li>scikit-image</li>
  <li>OSGeo</li>
  <li>TensorFlow &lt; 2.0</li>
  <li>Keras</li>
  <li>h5py</li>
</ul>

<p>
After dependencies are fulfilled, modules can be installed in
GRASS GIS >= 7.8 using the <em>g.extension</em> module:
<div class="code"><pre>
g.extension extension=maskrcnn
</pre></div>
