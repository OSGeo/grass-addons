<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

This module allows a search of GCP's on two raster-maps with differents
levels  of automation.
<p>
The manual search is the default search, so it's possible to determine
the GCP's manually with the mouse.


<h4>Semiautomated-search</h4>

You have to determine with the mouse some corrispondent areas (with a
discrete precision) in the two maps and the module searches the GCP's in
these areas. 


<h4>Automated-search</h4>
At the start of module you have to load the maps that the algorithm uses
to the search, so it's recommended to use the maps filtered with the
filters DIVERSITY or STDDEV  (of GRASS) with a window of 3x3 or 5x5
pixels. However, the algorithm sometimes work well with the original
maps too.
<p>
You click the button Automated-Search and then you have to load the maps
that you want to visualize at the end of the search (with the GCP's),
usually they are the original maps.
<p>
If the maps have strong geometric distortion and strong geometric
differencies, maybe  the results of the search (with the default
options) are not good, so you can click the  button LESS-GCP's and then
repeat the operation. 
<p>
The Overlap-Points (O.P.) era two corresponding points (one for every
maps) that is  used from the algorithm to determine the overlapping-area
in the two maps. The Master-map is considered the map on the left, and
the Slave-map is the map on the right.
<p>
Center, top, bottom, left, right are the position of the Master
Overlap-Point (on the  left map) that will be searched on the Slave map
(right map). Center is the point at the center of the map. Top, bottom,
left, right are the position of the O.P. respect to the center of the
map. If you choose one of these possibilities, then you have to  choose
the shift from the center, measured in percentage of the dimensions of
the map; there are two possibilities: 5% and 10%. This type of search is
the most automated (fully-automated ).
<p>
If you choose -MARK SLAVE O.P.-, then the module visualizes a blue point
at the center  of the master map, and you have to mark the corrispondent
point on the slave map. You can use this function if the maps are
overlapped for more of 50% and if the  algorithm doesn't have success in
the fully-automated search.
<p>
If the maps have a overlapping area less of 50%, you can use the
function -MARK M and S O.P.-. You have to mark a point in the master map
and the corresponding point on the slave map.
<p>
At the end of search it's possible to exclude automatically the points
not really  corresponding. This function use the rms with a threshold.
The default-value for the threshold is 2.5, but (before to active the
Auto-Exclusion) you can change it, chossing one of different proposed
values; you can choose an arbitrary value with  click on -OTHER-, so you
go on the shell and digit the value from keyboard and confirm  with
ENTER.
