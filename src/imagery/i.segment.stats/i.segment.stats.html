<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>
<em>i.segment.stats</em> calculates statistics for areas in a raster
map. Areas are defined by adjacent pixels with the same value. Such
areas can be the output of <em><a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/i.segment.html">i.segment</a></em> or
<em><a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/r.clump.html">r.clump</a></em>.

<p>
Available statistics are those related to the shape, size and position of the
areas (see the <em><a href="r.object.geometry.html">r.object.geometry</a></em>
addon man page for more information on the statistics) and aggregated statistics
of pixel values of other raster maps (see 
<em><a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/r.univar.html">r.univar</a></em> for details).

<p>
In addition, for each of the above statistics, the <b>-n</b> flag allows the 
user to request the output of the mean and the standard deviation of the values
of the neighboring objects (all direct neighbors, diagonal neighbors included),
which allows gathering some context information for each object. For this 
feature, the <em><a href="r.neighborhoodmatrix.html">r.neighborhoodmatrix</a></em>
addon has to be installed. Currently, the module calculates these context 
statistics for all available shape and spectral statistics. 

<p>
The user can chose between output in the form of a vector map of the
areas with the statistics in the attribute table (<b>vectormap</b>)
and/or in the form of a CSV text file (<b>csvfile</b>).

<p>
Because of the way <em><a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/r.univar.html">r.univar</a></em> functions, it
is difficult to handle cases where in some raster maps values are all null 
in some of the areas. Because of this, <em>i.segment.stats</em> checks the 
raster maps for existing null values and excludes them if it find any, emitting 
a warning to inform the user. The user can decide to ignore this check using the
<b>c</b> flag, for example when there are only a few null cells and no complete
areas with only null cells (i.e. the module can calculate statistics for areas 
with some null cells in them).

<h2>NOTES</h2>

<p>
The module respects the current region settings. The <b>-r</b> flag allows
to force the module to adjust the region to the input raster map before
calculating the statistics.

<p>
This module is a simple front-end to <em><a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/r.univar.html">r.univar</a></em>
and the 
<em><a href="r.object.geometry.html">r.object.geometry</a></em>
add-on. It is the user's responsibility to install the
latter using <em><a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/g.extension.html">g.extension</a></em>. If other statistics 
are desired, these should probably be implemented in those (or other) modules
which can then be called from this module.

<p>
Problems can arise in the calculation of some form statistics for certain
segment forms. If errors arise, the user might want to try to run 
<em><a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/r.clump.html">r.clump</a></em> on the input raster file before running
<em>i.segment.stats</em>.

<p>
When treating files with a large number objects, creating the vector map
can be very time-consuming. In that case, it might be easier to only work
with the <b>csvfile</b> output.

<p>
The processing of several raster input files for which to calculate per-segment
statistics can be parallelized by setting the <b>processes</b> parameter to the
number of desired parallel processes, with at most one process per raster to 
be treated.
