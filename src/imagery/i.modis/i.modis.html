<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

The <em>i.modis</em> suite is a toolset to import MODIS (Moderate
Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, flown on the two NASA spacecrafts
Terra and Aqua) satellite data into GRASS GIS. It uses the
<a href="http://www.pymodis.org">pyModis</a> library and additionally
either the <a href="http://gdal.org/">GDAL library</a> or the
<a href="https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/tools/modis_reprojection_tool">MODIS Reprojection Tool</a> (MRT)
software to convert, mosaic and process MODIS data.
<p>
The <em>i.modis</em> suite requires the pyModis library and either the GDAL or MRT
software to be installed.
<p>
The <em>i.modis</em> suite offers two modules as interface to MODIS data. Each module
is dedicated to a specific operation. The module <em>i.modis.download</em>
is used to download MODIS HDF products from NASA servers. These files can then
be imported with <em>i.modis.import</em> which supports import of Level 3
MODIS products as a single image or as a mosaic into GRASS GIS.
<p>
Subsequently, the user can create a temporal dataset using <em>t.create</em> and, register
the maps with <em>t.register</em>. NOTE: In order to work with the temporal framework of
GRASS GIS the flag <em>w</em> must be set during the import with <em>i.modis.import</em>.
<p>
The user can choose from several MODIS products, distributed as single or multiple tiles
and also ranges of observation days retrieving data from the related NASA servers.
<!--
The suite process Level 2 data using the <em>i.modis.process</em> module.
-->
The suite imports Level 3 (georeferenced) products either as single images or as mosaics for
each date.

<h2>Supported MODIS products</h2>
These products are currently supported:

<h3>MODIS Surface Reflectance</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Surface spectral reflectance daily 1 km and 500 m (Terra/Aqua)</b>: Bands 1 through 7
      corrected for atmospheric conditions such as gasses, aerosols, and Rayleigh
      scattering in Sinusoidal projection daily. Provided along with the 500 meter (m)
      surface reflectance, observation, and quality bands are a set of ten 1 kilometer
      observation bands and geolocation flags. The reflectance layers from MOD09GA and MYD09GA
      are used as the source data for many of the MODIS land products 
      (related <a href="https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/mod09gav061/">MOD09GA</a> and
      <a href="https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/myd09gav061/">MYD09GA</a>

<h3>MODIS VI - Vegetation Indices</h3>

<ul>
  <li><b>VI sixteen days 250 m (Terra/Aqua)</b>: Global MOD13Q1/MYD13Q1 MODIS vegetation indices
      are designed to provide consistent spatial and temporal comparisons of vegetation.
      conditions. Blue, red, and near-infrared reflectances, centered at 469-nanometers,
      645-nanometers, and 858-nanometers, respectively, are used to determine
      the MODIS daily vegetation indices.<br>
      The MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) complements NOAA's
      Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) NDVI products and provides
      continuity for time series historical applications. MODIS also includes a
      new Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) that minimizes canopy background variations
      and maintains sensitivity over dense vegetation conditions. The EVI also
      uses the blue band to remove residual atmosphere contamination caused by
      smoke and sub-pixel thin cloud clouds. The MODIS NDVI and EVI products are
      computed from atmospherically corrected bi-directional surface reflectances
      that have been masked for water, clouds, heavy aerosols, and cloud shadows.
      Global MOD13Q1/MYD13Q1 data are provided every 16 days at 250-meter spatial resolution
      as a gridded level-3 product in the Sinusoidal projection. Lacking a 250m
      blue band, the EVI algorithm uses the 500m blue band to correct for residual
      atmospheric effects, with negligible spatial artifacts
      (related <a href="https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/mod13q1v061/">MOD13Q1</a> and
      <a href="https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/myd13q1v061/">MYD13Q1</a>
      product pages).</li>
  <li><b>VI sixteen days 500 m (Terra/Aqua)</b>: Global MOD13A1/MYD13A1 MODIS vegetation indices
      are designed to provide consistent spatial and temporal comparisons of vegetation
      conditions. Blue, red, and near-infrared reflectances, centered at
      469-nanometers, 645-nanometers, and 858-nanometers, respectively, are used
      to determine the MODIS daily vegetation indices.<br>
      The MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) complements NOAA's
      Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) NDVI products provide
      continuity for time series historical applications. MODIS also includes a
      new Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) that minimizes canopy background
      variations and maintains sensitivity over dense vegetation conditions.
      The EVI also uses the blue band to remove residual atmosphere contamination
      caused by smoke and sub-pixel thin cloud clouds. The MODIS NDVI and EVI
      products are computed from atmospherically corrected bi-directional surface
      reflectances that have been masked for water, clouds, heavy aerosols, and
      cloud shadows.<br>
      Global MOD13A1/MYD13A1 data are provided every 16 days at 500-meter spatial
      resolution as a gridded level-3 product in the Sinusoidal projection.
      Vegetation indices are used for global monitoring of vegetation conditions
      and are used in products displaying land cover and land cover changes.
      These data may be used as input for modeling global biogeochemical and
      hydrologic processes and global and regional climate. These data also may
      be used for characterizing land surface biophysical properties and processes,
      including primary production and land cover conversion

  <li><b>VI sixteen days 250 m (Terra/Aqua)</b>:
      The MOD13Q1 product provides two primary vegetation layers. The first is the
      Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) which is referred to as the continuity
      index to the existing National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-Advanced
      Very High Resolution Radiometer (NOAA-AVHRR) derived NDVI. The second vegetation
      layer is the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), which has improved sensitivity
      over high biomass regions. The algorithm chooses the best available pixel value
      from all the acquisitions from the 16 day period. The criteria used is low
      clouds, low view angle, and the highest NDVI/EVI value. Along with the vegetation
      layers and the two quality layers, the HDF file will have MODIS reflectance
      bands 1 (red), 2 (near-infrared), 3 (blue), and 7 (mid-infrared), as well as
      four observation layers

<h3>MODIS AOD - Aerosol Optical Depth</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Aerosol optical depth daily 1 km (Terra+Aqua)</b>: MCD19A2 is
    the short name for the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric
    Correction (MAIAC) algorithm-based Level-2 gridded (L2G) aerosol
    optical thickness over land surfaces product. This product is
    derived using both Terra and Aqua MODIS inputs, and produced daily
    at 1 km pixel resolution in a Sinusoidal projection. MCD19A2 has
    achieved Stage-3 validation, and each Hierarchical Data Format 4
    (HDF4) file contains two data groups with the following Science
    Data Set parameters: Grid 1km: 1. Aerosol Optical Depth at 047
    micron / 2. Aerosol Optical Depth at 055 micron / 3. AOD
    Uncertainty at 047 micron / 4. Fine-Mode Fraction for Ocean /
    5. Column Water Vapor in cm liquid water / 6. AOD QA / 7. AOD
    Model (Regional background model used) / 8. Injection Height
    (Smoke injection height over local surface height) Grid 5km:
    9. Cosine of Solar Zenith Angle / 10. Cosine of View Zenith Angle
    / 11. Relative Azimuth Angle / 12. Scattering Angle / 13. Glint
    Angle. See the validation webpage for details on the validation
    and validation definitions
    (related <a href="https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/mcd19a2v006/">MCD19A2</a>

<h3>MODIS Snow</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Snow daily 500 m (Terra/Aqua)</b>: MOD10A1 and MYD10A1 are tiles of daily
      snow cover at 500 m spatial resolution. The daily observation selected from
      multiple observations in a MOD10A1 (or MYD10A1) cell is the observation
      acquired nearest nadir and having the greatest coverage of the grid cell.
      The daily MOD10A1 and MYD10A1 snow products are tiles of data gridded in the
      sinusoidal projection. Tiles are approximately 1200 x 1200 km in area. A
      single scientific data set (SDS) of snow cover and a single SDS of QA data
      along with local and global attributes comprise the data product file. The
      daily level 3 snow product is the result of selecting an observation from
      the multiple observations mapped to a cell of the MOD10_L2G (or MYD10_L2G)
      product. See the validation webpage for details on the validation and
      validation definitions
      (related <a href="https://nsidc.org/data/MOD10A1">MOD10A1</a> and
      <a href="https://nsidc.org/data/MYD10A1">MYD10A1</a>
      product pages).</li>
  <li><b>Snow eight days 500 m (Terra/Aqua)</b>: The MOD10A2 and MYD10A2 products
      are composites of eight days of snow maps in the sinusoidal grid.
      An eight-day compositing period was chosen because that is the exact ground
      track repeat period of the Terra and Aqua platforms. Snow cover over eight
      days is mapped as maximum snow extent in one SDS and as a chronology of
      observations in the other SDS. Eight-day periods begin on the first day of
      the year and extend into the next year. The product can be produced with
      two to eight days of input. There may not always be eight days of input,
      because of various reasons, so the user should check the attributes to
      determine on what days observations were obtained. See the validation webpage
      for details on the validation and validation definitions
      (related <a href="https://nsidc.org/data/MOD10A2">MOD10A2</a> and

<h3>MODIS Land Water Mask</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Land Water Mask 250 m (Terra)</b>: The Version 6 data product provides a global
  map of surface water at 250 meter (m) spatial resolution. The data are available annually
  from 2000 to 2015. MOD44W Version 6 is derived using a decision tree classifier trained
  with MODIS data and validated with the Version 5 MOD44W data product. A series of masks
  are applied to address known issues caused by terrain shadow, burn scars, cloudiness,
  or ice cover in oceans. A primary improvement in Version 6 is the generation of time
  series data rather than a simple static representation of water, given that water
  bodies fluctuate in size and location over time due to both natural and anthropogenic
  causes. Provided in each MOD44W Version 6 Hierarchical Data Format 4 (HDF4) file are
  layers for land, water, no data, and an associated per pixel quality assurance (QA)
  layer that provides users with information on the determination of water 
  (related <a href="https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/mod44wv006/">MOD44W</a>
