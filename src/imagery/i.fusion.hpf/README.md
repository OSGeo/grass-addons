`i.fusion.hpf` is a GRASS-GIS module to combine high-resolution 
panchromatic data with lower resolution multispectral data, resulting in an 
output with both excellent detail and a realistic representation of original 
multispectral scene colors.

The process involves a convolution using a High Pass Filter (HPF) on the high 
resolution data, then combining this with the lower resolution multispectral 
data.

Optionally, a linear histogram matching technique is performed in a way that 
matches the resulting Pan-Sharpened imaged to them statistical mean and standard 
deviation of the original multi-spectral image.

Algorithm description
=====================

1.  Computing ratio of low (Multi-Spectral) to high (Panchromatic) resolutions

2.  High Pass Filtering the Panchromatic Image

3.  Resampling MSX image to the higher resolution

4.  Adding weighted High-Pass-Filetred image to the upsampled MSX image

5.  Optionally, matching histogram of Pansharpened image to the one of the 
original MSX image

Installation
============

## Requirements
------------

see [GRASS Addons SVN repository, README file, Installation - Code Compilation](https://svn.osgeo.org/grass/grass-addons/README)

## Steps

Making the script `i.fusion.hpf` available from within any GRASS-GIS ver. 7.x session, may be done via the following steps:

1.  launch a GRASS-GIS’ ver. 7.x session

2.  navigate into the script’s source directory

3.  execute `make MODULE_TOPDIR=$GISBASE`

Usage
=====

After installation, from within a GRASS-GIS session, see help details via `i.fusion.hpf --help`

## Remarks

-   easy to use, i.e.:
 * for one band `i.fusion.hpf pan=Panchromatic msx=${Band}`
 * for multiple bands `i.fusion.hpf pan=Panchromatic msx=Red,Green,Blue,NIR`

-   easy to test various parameters that define the High-Pass filter’s *kernel size* and *center value*

-   should work with **any** kind of imagery (think of bitness)

-   the "black border" effect, possibly caused due to a non-perfect match of the high vs. the low resolution 
of the input images, can be trimmed out by using the `trim` option --a floating point "trimming factor" 
with which to multiply the pixel size of the low resolution image-- and shrink the extent of the output image

Implementation notes
====================

-   First commit on Sat Oct 25 12:26:54 2014 +0300

-   Working state reached on Tue Nov 4 09:28:25 2014 +0200


## To Do

- Go through <http://trac.osgeo.org/grass/wiki/Submitting/Python>

- Access input raster by row I/O ?

- Proper command history tracking. Not all "r" modules do it... ?

- Add timestamps (r.timestamp)

- Deduplicate code where applicable

- Make the -v messages shorter, yet more informative (ie report center cell)

- Test. Will it compile in other systems?

- Checking options to integrate in `i.pansharpen`. Think of FFM methods vs. 
Others? 

- Who else to thank?  Transfer from archive/
- Improve [Documentation.lyx](https://gitlab.com/NikosAlexandris/i.fusion.hpf/blob/master/lyx/Documentation.lyx)
