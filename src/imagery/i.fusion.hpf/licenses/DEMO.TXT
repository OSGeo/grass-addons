collectively referred to as "Product" or "Products", and 
a limited right to develop Derived Works as defined below. 
DigitalGlobe and End User may be referred to hereinafter 
individually as a "Party" and collectively as "Parties."  
All rights not expressly granted to End User are retained 
by DigitalGlobe.  In consideration for the rights granted 
under this End User License Agreement ("License"), End User 
agrees to be bound to the terms herein and agrees that this 
License shall govern the rights and obligations of the 
Parties. In the event that this License is inconsistent 
with any license included with the Products in electronic 
form or in any "shrink-wrap" form delivered with the Products, 
this License shall govern.

1. AUTHORIZED USERS.  The demonstration license applies to 
multiple users solely within the End User's organization at 
multiple locations.

2. LICENSE GRANTED AND PERMITTED USES.  By accepting the 
terms of this license, the End User is permitted the rights 
to use the Products internally at its facilities within its 
country of residence and to:

i	Make an unlimited number of copies for demonstration 
purposes.
ii	Modify the Products or use the Products to create 
Derived Works to support the demonstration activities.
iii	Display the Products to users outside of the Authorized 
User group with the DigitalGlobe logo conspicuously featured 
and provide appropriate copyright attribution.  However, copies 
of the Products shall not be given to those outside the 
Authorized User group.

4. PROHIBITED USES.   The End User shall not:

i	Copy or reproduce the Products (even if merged with other 
materials), other than as consistent with the Permitted Uses. 
ii	Sell, license, transfer or disclose the Products or use 
them in any manner not expressly authorized by this License.
iii	Alter or remove any copyright notice or proprietary legend 
contained in or on the Products or Derived Work.

the Products have been destroyed or returned to DigitalGlobe.   

5. DERIVED WORKS.  Derived Works that End User may create 
containing any data from the Products are subject to this 
license and End User acknowledges, and will cause its employees 
and agents to acknowledge, that DigitalGlobe and its licensors 
will own all rights in any copy, translation, modification, 
adaptation of such Derived Work.

6. TERMINATION.  Without prejudice to any other rights, DigitalGlobe 
may terminate this License by written notice to the End User if the 
End User fails to comply with the terms and conditions of this License.  
Upon termination, End User must discontinue use of the Products and 
certify in writing that all copies of the Products have been destroyed 
or returned to DigitalGlobe.

7.	LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.  DigitalGlobe provides 
a limited warranty for 30 days that the data delivered will be of 
the area of interest ordered and the media used to carry the

DigitalGlobe's sole liability shall be to replace the 
media if the media (not the data encoded thereon) is defective 
and the End User returns the media to DigitalGlobe within 30 
days of delivery.  WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE PRECEDING WARRANTY, 
THE PRODUCTS ARE PROVIDED WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS 
OR IMPLIED, AND ALL WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, 
AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.  DIGITALGLOBE 
DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE PRODUCTS WILL MEET THE END USER'S NEEDS 
OR EXPECTATIONS, OR THAT OPERATIONS OF THE PRODUCTS WILL BE ERROR 
FREE OR UNINTERRUPTED.  NO INFORMATION PROVIDED BY DIGITALGLOBE OR 
ITS AGENTS, EMPLOYEES, OR ITS RESELLERS OR DISTRIBUTORS SHALL CREATE 
A WARRANTY, OR IN ANY WAY INCREASE THE SCOPE OF THIS LIMITED WARRANTY, 
AND THE END USER IS NOT ENTITLED TO RELY ON ANY SUCH INFORMATION.

8.	NO CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES.  IN NO EVENT SHALL DIGITALGLOBE BE 
LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM OR LOSS INCURRED BY THE END USER, INCLUDING 
WITHOUT LIMITATION, COMPENSATORY, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, 
CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY OR OTHER NONCOMPENSATORY DAMAGES.

9.	MISCELLANEOUS.  

i	This License Agreement constitutes the complete and exclusive 
agreement between DigitalGlobe and the End User relating to its 
subject matter.  This License Agreement supersedes all prior and 
contemporaneous representations, correspondence, proposals or 
agreements relating to its subject matter, whether oral or written.  
This License Agreement may be modified only by a written amendment 
signed by both DigitalGlobe and the End User.  If any provision is 
determined to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions 
of this License Agreement shall continue to be valid and enforceable.  
Neither this License Agreement nor any of the rights granted by it may 
be assigned or transferred by the End User without the prior written 
consent of DigitalGlobe.  This restriction on assignments or transfers 
shall apply to assignments or transfers by operation of law, as well as 
by contract, merger or consolidation.  Any attempted assignment or 
transfer in derogation of this prohibition is void.
ii	The End User shall be responsible for obtaining any and all 
required governmental authorizations, including but not limited to 
any export or import licenses, and foreign exchange permits. 
iii	This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of
