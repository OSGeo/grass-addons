this License shall govern.

1. AUTHORIZED USERS.  The demonstration license applies to
multiple users solely within the End User's organization at

them in any manner not expressly authorized by this License.

days of delivery.  WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE PRECEDING WARRANTY,
THE PRODUCTS ARE PROVIDED WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS

ITS AGENTS, EMPLOYEES, OR ITS RESELLERS OR DISTRIBUTORS SHALL CREATE
A WARRANTY, OR IN ANY WAY INCREASE THE SCOPE OF THIS LIMITED WARRANTY,
AND THE END USER IS NOT ENTITLED TO RELY ON ANY SUCH INFORMATION.

8.	NO CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES.  IN NO EVENT SHALL DIGITALGLOBE BE
LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM OR LOSS INCURRED BY THE END USER, INCLUDING

CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY OR OTHER NONCOMPENSATORY DAMAGES.

9.	MISCELLANEOUS.

be assigned or transferred by the End User without the prior written
consent of DigitalGlobe.  This restriction on assignments or transfers
shall apply to assignments or transfers by operation of law, as well as
by contract, merger or consolidation.  Any attempted assignment or
transfer in derogation of this prohibition is void.
