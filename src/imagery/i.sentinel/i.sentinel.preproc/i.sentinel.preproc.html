<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>i.sentinel.preproc</em> allows to import Sentinel-2
images and perform atmospheric and topographic correction.
<p> <em>i.sentinel.preproc</em> is a module
for the preprocessing of Sentinel-2 images (Level-1C Single Tile product) which
wraps the import, the atmospheric and the topographic correction using respectively
<a href="i.sentinel.import.html">i.sentinel.import</a>,
<a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/i.atcorr.html">i.atcorr</a> and <a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/i.topo.corr.html">i.topo.corr</a>.<br>
It works both with Sentinel-2A and 2B images.<br>
The aim is to provide a simplified module which allows importing images, which
area downloaded using
<a href="i.sentinel.download.html">i.sentinel.download</a> or any other sources,
and performing the atmospheric correction avoiding users to provide all the
required input parameters manually. In fact, regarding the atmospheric
correction performed with <em>i.atcorr</em> one of the most challenging steps,
especially for unexperienced users, is the compiling of the control file with
all the required parameters to parametrize the 6S (<em>Second Simulation of
Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum</em>) model on which <em>i.atcorr</em> is
based.
<p>
To run <em>i.atcorr</em>, users have to provide the so-called control
file in which all the parameters (geometrical conditions, date, time, longitude
and latitude of the center of the scene, atmospheric model, aerosol model,
visibility or Aerosol Optical Depth -AOD- value, mean elevation target and
bands number) have to be specified with precise syntax rules and codes.<br>
<em>i.sentinel.preproc</em> retrieves as many parameters as possible from the metadata
file (e.g. Geometrical conditions, data and time and bands number), longitude
and latitude are automatically computed from the computational region while
others like the mean target elevation above sea level from the input digital
elevation model (DEM). Only a few parameters have to be provided by users who
can choose the proper option from a drop-down menu thus avoiding to enter the
corresponding code. In any case, <em>i.sentinel.preproc</em> writes a temporary control
file, changing it according to the band number, following the syntax rules and
codes of <em>i.atcorr</em> and then it runs <em>i.atcorr</em> for all bands.
Using the <em>c</em> flag <em>i.sentinel.preproc</em> is able to perform also
the topographic correction using <a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/i.topo.corr.html">i.topo.corr</a>
creating the needed information as the illumination model based on the elevation
model provided by the user.

</center>

<p>
When all bands have been processed by the integrated version of <em>i.atcorr</em>, an
histogram equalization grayscale color scheme is applied.

<p>
If the <b>-t</b> flag is set, a text file ready to be used as input for
<a href="i.sentinel.mask">i.sentinel.mask</a> will be created. In this case a name
for the output text file has to be specified.

<p>
NOTE: as for <em>i.atcorr</em>, current region settings are ignored. The region is
temporary set to maximum image extent and restored at the end of the process.

<p>
<em><b>Important</b></em>: <em>i.sentinel.preproc</em> requires all the bands of a
Sentinel-2 images. If the module is used only for the atmospheric correction,
all bands from *_B01 to *_B12 must be imported.
<br>Moreover, the original bands
name has to be kept unchanged (e.g if the original name is
<em>T17SPV_20180315T160021_B02</em> the imported raster map in the GIS DATABSE
must be named <em>T17SPV_20180315T160021_B02</em>).


<h3>Import</h3>

<em>i.sentinel.preproc</em> allows the import of all the bands of a Sentinel-2 image.
The required input is the <b>.SAFE folder</b> downloaded using
<em>i.sentinel.download</em> or any other source (e.g. Copernicus Open Access Hub). Note
that in the case that spatial reference system of input data differs from GRASS
location, the input data are reprojected.
<br>
The number of imported bands <b>can not</b> be reduced, all bands are automatically
imported by default.
<p>
<em><b>Important</b></em>: <em>i.sentinel.preproc</em> allows the import of one image at
a time because the input <b>.SAFE folder</b> is also used to automatically identify
the corresponding metadata file that is used during the atmospheric
correction.
<p>
The import can be skipped using the <b>-i</b> flag. Note that even if the
import is skipped the input <b>.SAFE folder</b> must be specified to automatically
retrieve the metadata file.

<h3>Atmospheric correction</h3>
<p>
<em>i.sentinel.preproc</em> allows performing atmospheric correction of all bands of a
Sentinel-2 scene with a single process using <em>i.atcorr</em>. Unlike <em>i.atcorr</em>, it
writes the control file changing it according to the band number. The only
required inputs are:
<ul>
    <li><b>input_dir</b> = the *.SAFE directory where the image and metadata file (MTD_MSIL1C.xml or S2A_OPER_MTD_SAFL1C_PDMC_*.xml depending on naming convention) are stored,
    <li><b>elevation</b> = raster of a digital elevation model,
    <li><b>visibility or AOD value</b> = raster of a visibility map or an AOD value (<em>see AOD section</em>),
    <li><b>Atmospheric model</b> = to be choosen from the drop-down menu,
    <li><b>Aerosol model</b> = to be choosen from the drop-down menu,
	<li><b>suffix</b> = a suffix for the output maps name
	<li><b>rescale</b> = the output range of values for the corrected bands, for example: 0-255, 0-1, 1-10000 (default value 0-1).
</ul>
<br>
The module writes the control file automatically starting from the input above.

<h4>Control file</h4>

<em>i.atcorr</em> requires a control file to parametrize the 6S algorithm on which it is
based.

<p>
Below an example of the control file, taken from the <em>i.atcorr</em> manual page, of a
Sentinel-2A image:

<div class="code"><pre>
25                            - geometrical conditions = Sentinel-2A
5 4 19.737 -78.727 35.748     - month day hh.ddd longitude latitude ("hh.ddd" is in decimal hours GMT)
2                             - atmospheric model = midlatitude summer
1                             - aerosols model = continental
0                             - visibility [km] (aerosol model concentration)
0.07                          - AOD at 550nm
-0.124                        - mean target elevation above sea level [km]
-1000                         - sensor height (here, sensor on board a satellite)
167                           - sensor band = Sentinel2A Blue band B2
</pre></div>

Using <em>i.sentinel.preproc</em> the only parameters from the list above that users
have to provide are: atmospheric model, aerosol model, visibility or AOD value.
The others are automatically retrieved from the metadata file, input elevation
map and bands.

<p>
<ol>
<li><b>Geometrical conditions</b>
<p>
The geometrical condition of the satellite are read from the metadata file and
converted to the corresponding <em>i.atcorr</em> code, 25 for Sentinel-2A mission and 26
for Sentinel-2B.

<p>
<li><b> Date, time, longitude and latitude </b>
<p>
Date (month and day) and time are read from the metadata file. The date (with
the format YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ) is converted in a standard format and only the
month and the day are selected and added to the control file.
<p>
Time is
already in Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), as <em>i.atcorr</em> requires, and it's
automatically converted to decimal hours.<br> Longitude and latitude are
computed from the computational region and converted to WGS84 decimal
coordinates.

<p>
<li><b> Atmospheric model</b>
<p>
Only some options are available:
<ul>
    <li>Automatic
    <li>No gaseous absorption
    <li>Tropical
    <li>Midlatitude summer
    <li>Midlatitude winter
    <li>Subarctic summer
    <li>Subarctic winter
    <li>Us standard 62
</ul><br>
Users can choose the proper option from a drop-down menu. The desired model is
automatically converted to the corresponding code and added to the control
file.

<p>
<em><b>Automatic</b> option</em><br>
The default option is <em>Automatic</em> which consists in the automatic
identification of the proper atmospheric model for the input image. The
<em>Automatic</em> option reads the latitude of the center of the computational
region and uses it to choose between Midlatitude (15.00 > lat <= 45.00),
Tropical (-15.00 > lat <= 15.00) and Subarctic (45.00 > lat <= 60.00) for
Northern Hemisphere (obviously it also works for the Southern Hemisphere).
Then, the month from the acquisition date is used to distinguish summer or
winter in case of Midlatitude or Subarctic model. Once the proper atmospheric
model is identified, it is converted to the corresponding code and added to the
control file.<br> Note that this is a simplified and standardized method to
identify the atmospheric model. Obviously, it is possible to choose other
options from those available.

<p>
<li><b> Aerosol model</b><br>
<p>
Also in this case, only some options are available and users have to select the
desired one from the drop-down menu, then it is converted to the corresponding
code and added to the control file.
<ul>
    <li>no aerosols
    <li>continental model
    <li>maritime model
    <li>urban model
    <li>shettle model for background desert aerosol
    <li>biomass burning
    <li>stratospheric model
</ul><br>
No automatic procedure has been implemented in this case.

<p>
<li><b> Visibility or AOD </b><br>
<p>
By default, <em>i.sentinel.preproc</em> uses the input visibility map to estimate a
visibility value to be added in the control file. If no visibility map is
available for the processed scene, it is possible to use an estimated Aerosol
Optical Depth (AOD) value checking the <b>-a</b> flag.<br>
If the <b>-a</b> flag is checked and a visibility map is provided, the visibility will
be ignored and no mean visibility value will be computed and added to the
control file. Whereas, if the <b>-a</b> flag isn't checked and an AOD value is
provided it will be ignored and not added to the control file.
<p>
In the same way, if the <b>-a</b> flag is checked and a visibility map is
provided it will be excluded from atmospheric correction process.

<p>
<b> AOD</b>
<p>
The AOD value can be specified by users (e.g. <tt>aod_value=0.07</tt>) or
automatically retrieved from an AERONET file to be given as input instead of
the AOD value.<br> <em>i.sentinel.preproc</em> reads the AERONET file, identify the
closest available date to the scene date and compute AOD at 550nm using the
closest upper and lower wavelength to 550 (e.g. 500nm and 675nm) and applying
the Angstrom coefficient.
<p>

The type of AERONET file is a Combined file for All Points (Level 1.5 or
2.0)<br> To download this kind of file:<br>
<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="http://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/webtool_opera_v2_inv">http://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov</a>
<li>Choose the site you want to get data from
<li>Choose the data you want to get data for
<li>Tick the box near the bottom labelled as 'Combined file (all products without phase functions)'
<li>Choose either Level 1.5 or Level 2.0 data. Level 1.5 data is unscreened, so contains far more data meaning it is more likely for users to find data near your specified time
<li>Choose 'All Points' under Data Format
<li>Download the file
<li>Unzip (the file has a .dubovik extension)
</ol>

<p>
Then, giving this file as input (e.g.
<tt>aeronet_file=your_path/*.dubovik</tt>), the AOD at 550nm will be
automatically computed and added to the control file.
<p>
NOTE: as in <em>i.atcorr</em>
manual explained, if an AOD value is provided a value 0 for the visibility has to
be entered with the AOD value in the following line. Obviously,
<em>i.sentinel.preproc</em> takes into account this syntax rule and automatically adds a
0 value for visibility (or -1 if AOD=0) if an AOD value is provided (through
both <tt>aod_value</tt> and <tt>aeronet_file</tt>).

<p>
<li><b> Mean target elevation above sea level </b><br>
<p>
Mean target elevation above sea level is automatically estimated from the input
digital elevation model. According to the rules for writing the contol file of
<em>i.atcorr</em>, the mean elevation value is added as a negative value and converted
in kilometers (e.g. if mean=121 in the control file it will be written in
[-km], i.e., -0.121).

<p>
<li><b> Sensor height </b><br>
<p>
Since the sensor is on board a satellite, the sensor height is automatically
set to -1000.

<p>
<li><b> Sensor band </b><br>
<p>
The number of the band changes automatically according to the band that is
processed at that moment. The module reads the name of the band and converts it
into the corresponding code.
</ol>

<h3>Topographic correction</h3>
<em>i.sentinel.preproc</em> allows performing the topographic correction of all bands
of a Sentinel-2 scene with a single process using <a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/i.topo.corr.html">i.topo.corr</a>.
<em>i.sentinel.preproc</em> calculate the zenit and azimuth angles using
<a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/r.sunmask.html">r.sunmask</a>, after that it create the illumination model based on
the elevation model and apply it to all the bands of a Sentinel-2 scene

<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>
<p>
The example illustrates how to run <em>i.sentinel.preproc</em> for a Sentinel-2A image
(S2A_MSIL1C_20180315T160021_N0206_R097_T17SPV_20180315T194425.SAFE) in the
North Carolina location.<br> The AERONET file has been downloaded from the
<em>EPA-Res_Triangle_Pk</em> station.
