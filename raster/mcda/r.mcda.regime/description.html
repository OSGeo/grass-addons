<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
<em>r.mcda.regime </em> is the implementation of the REGIME multicriteria algorithm in GRASS GIS environment. It is one of the available tools in the r.mcda suite. It requires as an input the list of raster representing the criteria to be assessed in the multicriteria evaluation and the vector of weights to be assigned. Every single cell of the GRASS region is considered as one of the possible alternatives to evaluate and it is described with the value assumed for the same cell by the raster used as criteria. </P>
<BR>
<H2>NOTES</H2>
<P>The module does not standardize the raster-criteria. Therefore, they must be prepared before by using, for example, r.mapcalc. The weights vector is always normalized so that the sum of the weights is 1.</P>
