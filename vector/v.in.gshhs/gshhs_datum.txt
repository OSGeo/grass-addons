"A continental land mask was created from the global, self-consistent,
hierarchical, high-resolution shoreline database (GSHHS) compiled by Wessel
and Smith (1996). The GSHHS is public domain digital coastline file available
from the School of Ocean and Earth Science Technology at the University of
Hawaii12 and the NOAA National Geophysical Data Center 13 (NGDC) and contains
coastlines and closed waterbodies extracted from two widely used public domain
databases, the World Data Bank II coastline (WDB) and the World Vector
Shoreline (WVS). Lohrenz (1988) indicated that the working scale of the WVS
data is about about 1:250,000 and is referenced to the World Geodetic System
of 1972 (WGS-72) horizontal datum and the mean high water (MHW) vertical
datum."

Hi GMT users-

Each year I get a few questions like these:

1. "I am making a plot of a small area, using pscoast -Df, and the island that
   I used to visit as a kid does not show up (or lake, or river, etc)"

2. "When I compared the coastline from pscoast with GPS measurements, the
   coastline seems shifted by a few hundred meters"

3. "Where this river is wide it is missing entirely, with the result that
   some of the islands in the river show up as lakes"

To simplify the answer, I will assume you have read Appendix K in the GMT
Reference & Cookbook section on how the GSHHS coastlines were put together.

Answers:

  There are many possibilities:
   a) The feature was missing in the original WVS (land outlines) or WDBII
      (lakes, rivers, boundaries) data set.
   b) The feature was eaten by our preprocessing steps.
   c) WVS and WDBII were sometimes incompatible.
   d) Different datums were used
   
   One must remember that the WVS coastline is much higher accuracy than the
   WDBII lakes and rivers. It has happened that a feature that was considered
   a coastal lake in WVS (i.e., it did not break the shoreline and thus was
   not included in WVS) was a bay in WDBII (and thus not included as a lake).
   The result is that the lake never appeared in GSHHS.
   Likewise, rivers do not always end at the coastline; it may cross it or not
   quite make it to the ocean.

How can we improve the data? Ideally, we would prefer that some agency
announces a sucessor to WVS and WDBII that is better, and we can start from
that point. We do not want to be the curators of these data. In the mean time:

1. If you can show us that a missing feature is indeed in the original
   WVS or WDBII data then _maybe_ I can find time to check the processing
code.
   I need much motivation to dig into all that stuff again.

2. If you have a high-resolution (i.e., comparable to other features in -Df)
   digital version of the missing feature, please email it to us with an
   explanatory note. We may then incorporate it in the next version.

3. The rivers seem to be messed up, either in the source or by us. If you
   have digitized missing pieces please share them with us.

4. The shift that some have documented may be related to datum. If anybody
   knows what reference ellipsoid was used for WVS and WDBII we would like
   to hear it. We made no correction to the lon/lat when making the data
   compilation.

5. We still miss some recent political borders. It may be premature to
  add lines in the Balkans, but if you have high-quality political borders
  not in GMT, please share with us.
