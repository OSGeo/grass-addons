<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<EM>v.colors</EM> is like r.colors but for vector maps.
You give it a vector map and data column, together with color rules like
you would do for a raster. It creates a new column in the database with
R:G:B values suitable for use with 'd.vect -a'.

Hopefully it helps supplement the ongoing thematic mapping efforts.
It is mildly tested so far and pretty simple; seems to be ~75% error
checking code.

How it works: it creates a dummy raster map with the same data range as
the vector's column then runs r.colors on that. Then it uses
r.what.colors for each value found by v.db.select and uploads it to the
DB. Better would be a C module which rendered directly instead of saving
the colors in the DB.

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

Colorizing a TIN generated by <em>v.delaunay</em>:

<div class="code"><pre>
# new columns for x,y,z of centroids
v.db.addtable tin col="east double precision, north double precision, height double precision, GRASSRGB varchar(11)"

# transfer geometry for colorizing (we need the centroid height)
v.to.db tin opt=coor col="east,north,height"
v.db.select tin

v.colors tin column=height rgb_column=GRASSRGB color=rainbow

# display colorized triangles
d.mon x0
d.vect -a tin
</pre></div>
